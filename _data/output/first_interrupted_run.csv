For example, suppose we want to find any line in which a particular word, for example, aardvark, appears twice. We can specify this with the regular expression /aardvark.*aardvark/.', 'One very important special character is the period (/./), a wildcard expression that matches any single character (except a carriage return), as shown in Fig. 2 .6.', 'The square braces can also be used to specify what a single character cannot be, by use of the caret ˆ. If the caret ˆ is the first symbol after the open square brace [, the resulting pattern is negated. For example, the pattern /[ˆa]/ matches any single character (including special characters) except a. This is only true when the caret is the first symbol after the open square brace. If it occurs anywhere else, it usually stands for a caret; Fig. 2.4 shows some examples.', 'Finally, certain special characters are referred to by special notation based on the backslash (\\) (see Fig. 2 .10). The most common of these are the newline character newline \\n and the tab character \\t. To refer to characters that are special themselves (like ., *, [, and \\) , precede them with a backslash, (i.e., /\\./, /\\*/, /\\[/, and /\\\\/).', '• It is replaced with the unique vocabulary token [MASK] .']","[0.6157941818237305, 0.4472956657409668, 0.4467812776565552, 0.44579923152923584, 0.4034285545349121]","The Kleene star means ""zero or more occurrences of the immediately previous character or regular expression""","This language consists of strings with a b, followed by at least two a's, followed by an exclamation point. The set of operators that allows us to say things like ""some number of as"" are based on the asterisk or *, commonly called the Kleene * (gen-Kleene * erally pronounced ""cleany star""). The Kleene star means ""zero or more occurrences of the immediately previous character or regular expression"". So /a*/ means ""any string of zero or more as"". This will match a or aaaaaa, but it will also match Off Minor since the string Off Minor has zero a's. So the regular expression for matching one or more a is /aa*/, meaning one a followed by zero or more as. More complex patterns can also be repeated. So /[ab]*/ means ""zero or more a's or b's"" (not ""zero or more right square braces""). This will match strings like aaaa or ababab or bbbb.",tensor([[0.4220]]),tensor([[0.5622]])
