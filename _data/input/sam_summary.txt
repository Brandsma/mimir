VARBANOVA - STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
Chapter 1 - Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Arts (A Strategic Approach)
Introduction
● Philosophical notions of culture, arts, heritage and creativity differ a lot
○ Culture: system of shared values, beliefs, customs, behaviours etc. which members of society
develop and transmit to the next generations
● Creative (or cultural) industries
○ Creative activities and organisations which are based on a creative process but are also
related t the mass production, commercialisation and distribution of cultural products with
the aim of gaining profit in return
○ Cultural industries are an immense source of added value in the society from an economic
viewpoint
● Arts and culture sector: refers to all types of organizations, as well as activities, projects and
initiatives in the field of arts and culture in a particular country
1. Types of organisations in the arts and culture sector
● Two main variables are important for the choice of an overall strategic management and planning
framework: the size of the organisation and the proportion of self-generated income versus
external financial support.
● Nonprofit organisations (non-commercial) (NPOs)
○ Provide services and programmes that benefit society
○ Do not aim to generate profit but can ‘financial surplus’ if this will be used for the
organization’s future activities
○ Depending on the country, the organisations may have tax-exempt or tax benefits
○ Independent and institutionally separate from government and business
○ Flexible organisational structures and small operational teams, often use volunteers
○ Most of funding comes from external support (in limited cases, they are allowed to perform
commercial activities)
○ Also called non governmental organisations (NGOs) → they operate independently
○ Rely on their member’s involvement and support
○ E.g. theatres, galleries, festival organisations, multimedia organisations, community centres
etc.
○ Grass-roots organization: initiative comes from people’s needs and that the mission is to
help provide a s specific social, cultural, educational, environmental and/or health-related
initiative in a neighbourhood
● Business organisation
○ Registered under trade law
○ Also called art-based business companies or art businesses
○ Rely entirely on sales revenues from selling goods and/or services (e.g. selling goods or
copyrights/royalties etc.)
○ Distribution of gained profits among owners and/or stakeholders and/or reinvest part of it
for future activities
○ Financial structure is mixed
○ Function entirely on market environment, and their artistic programming is driven mainly
by consumers’ and audiences’ needs, tastes and preferences
○ Based on mass production and distribution
● State-subsidized organisations (depending on the level at which they operate, scope and budgeting
structure)
○ National
■ Main portion of income comes from national budget
■ In every country there is at least one, or more than one, national cultural
organisation in each arts category (e.g. national drama theatre, national opera,
national museum etc.)
○ Regional
■ Subsidized mainly by the budgets of regional government authorities/specially
designed regionalö programmes or funds
■ Aim to provide higher autonomy for the regional authorities to decide on funding
and creative programming
○ Local and municipal
■ Primary funding from a municipality or a city council
○ Cultural institution: formal organisations of the government and public services; directly or
indirectly part of government
● Mixed (Public-private partnership)
○ Mixed ownership support (private donors and government bodies collaborate)
○ Have nonprofit legal status
● Other criteria (splitting into subsidized and commercial (based on their main source of income:
self-earned revenues or external financial support))
○ Income
■ Subsidized organisations
● Receive most of income from external sources (mainly from different levels
of government support)
● Subsidies are used to lower the price of the product and/or services
(increasing level of participation and consumption)
● Strategic management is heavily influenced by the overall cultural policy
framework in a country
■ Business (commercial) organisations
● Receive most of their income from commercial types of activities
● Function on market principles and through trading traditions
● Strategic management and planning are influenced by the overall analysis
and trends of the cultural (creative) industries
○ Scope of autonomy and independence
■ Independent organisations (registered as separate legal entity; independent
decisions)
■ Part of another entity (attached to a university, college, corporation, foundation etc.)
■ Collaborative entities (also called ‘artists’ collectives’ or ‘artist-run organisations’;
shared aims such as providing spaces for exhibitions etc.)
○ Balance between stability and mobility
■ Permanent (e.g. conventional museums, theatres etc.)
■ Temporary (project basis, gathered for only one show)
■ Touring and mobile (no permanent home place, constantly on the move)
■ Mixed (permanent creative team and external programming
○ New technologies
■ Offline organisations and projects (activities and interactions with audiences
primarily occur offline in physical spaces)
■ Online organisations, projects and platforms (might have physical office or
premises, most of activities happen online; e.g. social networking sites)
● Organisation: kind of arrangement, gathering of people who pursue collective goals
● Arts organisation: different types of organisations in the arts and culture sector
2. Arts organisation: resources, processes and results
● Resources
○ Identifying and using resources in an efficient manner
○ Two main categories
■ Tangible resources (financial or physical)
■ Intangible resources (intellectual property, reputation, goodwill etc.)
○ Human resources: core of every arts organisation; key to success
○ Creative teams: configuration and size of a creative team depend on the artistic field, the
nature of artwork and type of organisation; different forms of personnel
■ Primary creative personnel
■ Technical workers
■ Creative managers (mediators)
■ Marketing personnel
■ Owners and executives
■ Unskilled and semi-skilled labour
○ Input-process-output (scheme p. 6)
○ Financial resources (always needed to start up and run any activity): sales of core cultural
products, royalties from copyrights, sales of peripheral commercial products, additional
services (food, drinks etc.), external support (government, foundations, individual donors
etc.)
○ Material resources (e.g. goods to produce art): important ingredient for starting an
organization
○ Informational resources: ability of management teams to gather data etc.; very important
for defining strategic goals and strategies
● Processes
○ Creative process can be mixed with final result
○ To understand management and planning processes, it is useful to divide it into phases
○ Charme and difficulty of managing an arts organisation is the interdependency between
creative processes and other managerial and supplementary processes → many arts
organisations have two managerial positions with equally importance (artistic director and
manager)
● Results
○ Arts marketing deals with results
○ Measuring and reporting results, both internally and externally, is important
○ Two result categories
■ Tangible (material): artistic products → become goods when appearing on market
■ Intangible (non-material): services and other intangible results (e.g. recognition, joy,
entertainment etc.)
○ Other categories
■ Quantitative (measurable): based on data, numbers etc., everything that can be
measured (e.g. number of visitors)
■ Qualitative: aim of gaining an in-depth understanding of why and how certain
outcomes were achieved and what their wider impact is
○ Or other categories
■ Creative results: related to quality, evaluation, attitudes to a creative product
■ Marketing results: related to media coverage
■ Financial results: increased sales, donors, sponsors, earned income etc.; also
measure an organisation’s ability to function in an entrepreneurial mode
■ Organisational results: changes in management competences and skills of staff
■ Innovative results: new programmes, models or techniques
○ Measuring the interconnections between inputs and outputs
■ Effectiveness: degree to which a goal is achieved
■ Efficiency: time and efforts spent on an activity; ability to accomplish a job in the
best possible manner
■ Efficacy: emphasis on the capacity to achieve a final result; success in achieving a
goal
3. Innovations in the arts: categories of innovations
● Creativity and innovations
○ Creative processes make arts organisations unique but the concept has become important
in business processes as well (innovation) → creativity: having a new idea; innovation:
doing something with that idea
○ Difference between creativity and innovation: innovation also includes value innovation;
creativity is more about internal processes and operations, innovation is connecting to the
real world
● Characteristics of innovation
○ Always imply newness
○ Innovations are related to
■ Transformation and restructuring
■ Change (in an organisation, process, model, society…)
■ Generation of new value
■ Thinking that goes ‘beyond the box’
○ Need for innovative strategy (way to bring new products to the marketplace)
○ Social innovations (new ideas that resolve existing social, cultural, economic and
environmental challenges)
○ Why innovation is important?
■ Improve competitive advantages in ever changing environment
■ To be different than others
● Categories of innovations
○ Different people invented different models
○ Osterwalder and Pigneur
■ Resource-driven
■ Offer-driven
■ Customer-driven
■ Finance-driven
○ Others (there are 5 different models, I did not want to put them all here, I hope we don’t
need them.. :D)
● Innovations in arts organisations (categorisation if following input-process-output model)
○ From a theoretical point of view
■ Programme innovations
■ Innovation in the process (to improve ways of doing things)
■ Marketing innovations or innovations in the methods of circulating final art
products and services
■ Innovation in the resources (e.g. material, funds, informational resources)
■ Organisational and managerial innovations
■ Technical innovations (new technologies)
○ In reality, innovations are usually interrelated
● Innovations in strategic management
○ Innovations are the seeds for long-term success, sustainability and adaptability
4. Arts managers: profiles and functions
● Roles, functions and responsibilities vary significantly; vary depends on
○ Art category
○ Sector
○ Size or organisation, structure, managerial levels
○ Primary responsibility and function
● Cultural mediators: broad spectrum of skills (audience development, cultural interpretation etc.)
● Cultural animators (working with people and groups → stimulating their mental, physical and
emotional life)
● The managers constantly need to communicate with the outside world of the organization
● Of of main tasks: overall strategic management and planning process; treating three groups with
priority: artists, audience and supporters
● → constantly trying to decrease tension between all internal and external groups influencing
artistic quality, the image and visibility of an organisation and its overall financial situation
5. Entrepreneurship in the arts
● Managers work within framework of existing organisations, entrepreneurs are the ones who start
from an idea
● Concepts of entrepreneurship
○ Different people developed different concepts which connect entrepreneurship with
multiple other factors
● Entrepreneurs in the arts
○ Artpreneurship is sometimes used
○ Different people propose different definitions for the relationship between art and
entrepreneurship
○ Core elements (Hagoort): passion and affection around a clear cultural vision, an external
(market) orientation with an emphasis on innovation, and a societal responsibility
○ Arts entrepreneur covers all types of entrepreneurs operating in the arts and culture sector
(producers, impresarios, art dealers, arts agents, artist’s agents, project managers etc.)
○ Usually freelancers
○ Play intermediate role between artistic idea and audiences
○ Arts entrepreneurship: activating an innovate aspect of an organisation’s or project’s
development
○ Definition: Arts entrepreneurship is an economic as well as sociocultural activity, based on
innovations, exploitation of opportunities and risk-taking behaviour. It is visionary,
strategic, innovative and social activity.
○ Main characteristics which define the uniqueness of arts entrepreneurs
■ Social and cultural aspects of their work
■ Love for the arts and/or positive attitude to the arts
■ Ability to balance the tensions of internal and external groups
■ The need for social responsibility and public transparency (especially for projects
funded by public money)
■ Social leadership abilities
■ Networking, communication, and collaboration
■ Understanding of the multicultural context
■ Understanding and application of digital dimensions
■ → scheme on page 18: traits and competencies of a successful arts entrepreneur
➢ Successful arts entrepreneurs are visionary social leaders, strategic managers and social innovators
who have strong motivation and are not afraid to take risks while at the same time forecasting and
planning the future steps in the realisation of their idea.
6. Intrapreneurial (combination of entrepreneurship and management; also: corporate/internal
entrepreneurship) arts organisation: main characteristics
● Two perspectives to look on this concept
○ Individual: individuals who have traits and competencies of entrepreneurs but prefer to
work within an organisational environment; focus on innovation and creativity; skills in
negotiation, diplomacy, networking, building coalitions of supporters etc.; take
responsibility and risk
○ Organisational: type of organisation for intrapreneurship; freedom, encouragement and
support are important to create ideas; rigid, hierarchical and inflexible structures are
difficult here
● Elements of innovation and entrepreneurship are embedded in its strategic management process
● Main characteristics of intrapreneurial arts organisation
○ Evidence for elements of innovation or projects with innovative features
○ Establishment of teams or units to work on generation and implementation of innovative
ideas
○ Experimental, ‘laboratory’ climate
○ Securing of ongoing financial support for innovative projects
○ Commercial aspects: generating revenues as a result
○ Flexible organisational structure
○ Adaptability to changes
○ Ability to connect and network
7. Intrapreneurial process in an arts organisation
● 5 main phases of an intrapreneurial process in an arts organisation
○ 1. Establishment of an intrapreneurial climate
○ 2. Generation of innovative ideas (possible in different ways, no universal rules and
recommendations); depend on: previous experience of intrapreneur as arts manager, artist
or member of arts organisation/creative skills and direct involvement of
intrapreneur/other involvement by intrapreneur in the arts/country, region or city where
organisation is based; sources of new entrepreneurial ideas can be grouped into:
■ Internal methods: board discussions, feedback from staff etc.
■ External methods: feedback from audiences and clients, stakeholders etc.; research
○ 3. Evaluation and selection of rational ideas: filtering of ideas (see scheme page 22)
○ 4. Development of a portfolio of innovative projects
○ 5. Realisation of ideas
Chapter 2 - Strategic Management (Essence, Role and Phases)
● Planning as an essential function in management practice
1. Strategic management and planning: historical development
● Term: Strategic management or corporate strategy or business policy or strategic planning
● Early management theories: the model of organisations as closed systems
○ Management functions such as planning, organising etc. were first described by Henri Fayol
(1841-1925)
○ ‘Father of scientific management’: Frederick W. Taylor (1856-1915) → management is the
‘art of knowing what you want to do and then seeing that it is done in the best and cheapest
way’ (related to importance of planning)
○ Main characteristics of first period
■ Organisations as ‘closed systems’; planning dealt mainly with internal processes
■ No feedback from clients etc. was considered
■ Emphasis on management and planning of internal processes (no communication
tools with other organisations or environment)
■ Principle of planning: ‘extrapolation’ = from the past to the present and then the
future
● Strategic management as a discipline: the model of organisations as open systems
○ In 50s and 60s, the importance of environment and other external circumstances was
established → SWOT analysis = method to evaluate the Strengths and Weaknesses of an
organisation against the Opportunities and Threats in the environment (widely used
concept today)
○ ‘Father of strategic management’: Igor Ansoff (1918-2002)
■ He suggested four main strategies for an organisation’s growth: market penetration,
market development, product development and diversification
○ In the end of 20th century, management theory emphasized the importance of external
economic, social, political, technical and market forces for organisation’s development
○ Two main levels in management of organisations developed
■ Operational: covers all functional management ares (human resource management,
operations management, production management, marketing, financial
management etc.
■ Strategic: focused on strategies, tools and models to generate profit, expand new
markets, increase revenues and grow the company
● Strategic management and planning in the nonprofit sector
○ Between 70s and 90s, the management theories began to influence not only the business
sector but also service sector and nonprofit organisations
● Modern approaches to strategic management and planning: focus on leadership, innovation and
entrepreneurship
○ Theories in strategic management are not yet fully studied for arts and nonprofit
organisation; following researchers studied this field in regard to strategy, innovations and
entrepreneurship
■ Palmer and Kaplan
■ Bilton and Cummings → creative strategy
■ Amason → strategic management as process
○ Strategic innovation/innovative strategy: emphasising the need of having an ongoing
management innovation
● Strategic management in the arts and culture sector
○ Lack of publications in this area
2. Strategic management as a process to manage changes in arts organisations
● To solve strategic problems and achieve strategic aims
● Helps an organisation adjusting to a changed environment
● Definition
○ Analytical as well as practical process in which an arts organisation
■ 1. Sets up its mission, vision and long-term objectives
■ 2. Makes a profound diagnosis of its current state in terms of available resources
and potential for long-term development
■ 3. Analyses all possible strategies and alternative actions for achieving the desired
future state
■ 4. Chooses those which are the most effective considering the changing external
factors
■ 5. Implements them while constantly monitoring and controlling the whole process,
undertaking ongoing corrective measures where required, and considering feedback
for the next cycle of strategic planning
○ Differences in strategic planning of business or non-profit arts organization
- Business: focus on competitive advantage, current/future market segments,
competitive positioning, growth, expansion, generating higher profit
- Non-profit arts: audience engagement/education, social cause, preservation of
cultural heritage, participative approach
○ Strategic management process is similar to a road map (drawing a road within a time frame
and space to reach a final destination; combination of past, present and future)
○ An organisation’s mission and vision as a set of long-term objectives need to be defined
3. Phases of the strategic management process
● No universal framework; different authors = different fragmentation
○ David (1993)
■ Strategy formulation
■ Strategy implementation
■ Strategy evaluation
○ Thomson and Strickland (1996)
■ Formulating a strategic vision
■ Converting mission into measurable objectives
■ Developing and testing strategies
■ Implementing and executing the strategies
■ Evaluating performance and initiating adjustments
● Varbanova suggests a spiral process with 5 main phases (scheme p.31)
○ Phase I: Strategic Thinking
■ Gathering as much information as possible; involves intuition and creativity
■ Outcome: articulated vision of direction (the organisation’s overall organisational
identity)
○ Phase II: Strategic Analysis (Analysis of the external and internal environment)
■ E.g. SWOT analysis
○ Phase III: Strategic Planning
■ Two main subsections which also reflect the two levels in management structure
● Strategic level: evaluation of strategies and selection of the right set of
strategies
● Functional level: developing the functional parts of the plan
■ → strategic management theories emphasize the strategic level more than the
functional one
○ Phase IV: Implementation and Monitoring of the Strategic Plan
■ One of the core management functions
■ Monitor current activities, resources, staff, deadlines
■ Important to motivate all people = create sense of belonging
○ Phase V: Strategic Reflection: Measuring Results - Evaluation, Control and Corrective
Actions
■ Provides feedback, records diversions from the planned aims; success indicators
that help the next strategic planning process
■ Management is an ongoing process = needs communication between strategic level
and operational level
4. Reasons for strategic management in the arts
● Strategic thinking, analysis, planning helps and arts organisation:
○ Define mission, vision, goals to communicate well
○ See bigger picture
○ Understand its uniqueness, competitive advantage
○ Prioritise, focus
○ Develop, implement innovative projects, tools, methods
○ Balance creative programming and management actions, marketing, fundraising, external
context, cultural policy
○ Predictions
○ Increase efficiency, productivity
○ Self-sustaining in future
● Tabel 2.2: reasons
○ Financial and fundraising
○ Marketing and communications
○ Organisational and managerial
5. Why is strategic management for arts organizations special?
Unique characteristics or arts, creativity and creative processes:
● Arts organisations are usually headed by two key figures: artistic leader and manager
○ Synchronising strategic decisions
○ Different arguments for decision-making = different perspectives
○ Programme-market strategies help this tension
● Experimental character
○ New projects, initiatives
○ Level of risk
○ Risk analysis and management actions to decrease risks
● Financial resources = Not entirely predictable
○ Difficult to predict changes in external donors
○ Clients’ interests and involvement might change
○ Consumers rapidly changing choices
● External financial support
○ Innovative approaches to fundraising strategies are important for all types of arts
organisations
● investment/production costs are very high
○ Capital subsidies are necessary in some cases
● cultural/artistic activities cannot always be measured precisely
○ Also quality indicators are difficult to measure
● Arts organisations function as open systems with ongoing public involvement
○ Dependent on stakeholders
○ Ongoing monitoring of implementation
○ Flexibility
● Arts organisations offer public goods/services which have societal value
● Information about changes/trends in external factors difficult to obtain
6. Reasons for resistance to implementing strategic management in the arts
● Many arts organisations don’t implement strategic management
○ In small arts organisations:
■ Management based on improvisation, intuition
■ Informal processes
■ They want to act quickly + fast results
■ Might not have sufficient resources to elaborate strategic documents
○ Large organisations:
■ Might not see the need = rely on regular/large audiences, receive sufficient support
○ managers/members:
■ Don’t se practical need
■ Creativity can’t be planned
■ Strategic planning processes requires patience, time, resources, efforts = might not
have the time because occupied with daily matters, emerging issues
○ Certain arts organisations are based on membership
■ Strategic plan has to be elaborated on feedback, opinions of members
7. Key terminology in strategic management
● Strategy
○ Most effective chosen set of actions in a specific situation for achieving long-term objectives
○ Considering key internal/external factors
○ Evaluating different alternatives
● Strategic issues
○ Fundamental questions, policy-related matters, critical challenges
○ Three strategic issues:
1. Where no action is required, but must be monitored
2. Issues can be handled in planning cycle
3. Issues that require immediate response
● Mission and vision
○ Mission = brief statement of organisation’s purpose for existence
○ Vision = imaginary picture providing an idea of the desired future
● Objectives
○ Desirable, concrete, measurable goals
● External environment and PEST factors
○ Macro-external environment = PEST factors (political, economic, social, technological),
global, digital, natural, ecological
○ Micro-external environment = competitors, audiences, stakeholders, financial institutions,
funders
● Internal environment
○ Related to resources, systems, processes, people
○ Identifying strengths and weaknesses
● SWOT analysis
○ Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
○ Method to conduct situational analysis and choose strategic alternatives
○ Identify internal/external factors to achieve mission, objectives, innovative potential,
capacity to become financially sustainable
● Competitor analysis and competitive advantage
○ Analysis of competitors to perform better/achieve better results
● Stakeholder analysis
○ Important in nonprofit/subsidized arts organisations = not competitive but collaborative
environment
○ Directed towards satisfying expectations
Chapter 3 - Strategic Planning Process, Methods and Types of Plans
1. Strategic Planning: An Overview
● Elaboration of strategic document, programme, plan, concept, framework, serves as organisation’s
Bible = key for all management action
● Harvard policy model = one of the first methodologies for strategic planning for private business
companies
● Viewpoint on strategic planning originated in 1950s
○ Understanding how organisation functions in market environment
○ Strengths in comparison
○ Quantitative methods
● No single agreed definition
● Kaufman, Oakley-Browne, Watkin, Leigh
○ Strategic planning as formal process of defining the requirements for delivering high-payoff
results
● Grüning. Kühn:
○ Process by which strategies are produced
○ Characteristics:
■ Systematic process
■ Long-term orientation
■ Look at company as a whole
■ Determining potential for future success
■ Involve management team in process
■ Long-term accomplishment of company’s objectives, values
● Planning as tool of management that facilitates future decision-making
● Strategic planning can also help public organisations and also non-profit sector
○ Main benefits (John Bryson):
■ Promotion of strategic thoughts
■ Improved decision-making
■ Improved performance
■ Organisation of people to perform better
● Similarities between strategic planning in nonprofit, business, government organisations:
○ Deciding what and how to accomplish in dynamic environment
● Difference:
○ The nature of the internal and external forces that influence
2. Main strategic planning principles in the arts
● Balance aims with resources
● Balance creative programming with all other areas of strategic planning
● Maintaining flexibility and openness
● Reflect the complexity of the organisation
● Coordinate activities in an organisation horizontally as well as vertically
● Apply systematic approach
● Aim for long-term results
● Maintain continuity in a loop
● Use online tools
● Incorporate elements of intrapreneurship
● Use a participatory approach
3. Preparing for strategic planning
● Beforehand, it is necessary to make sure that members, stakeholders understand the principles and
orientation
○ An arts organisation has a strategic orientation if the following are present:
■ Purpose of existence, vision, objectives are clarified
■ Appropriate strategy is chosen
■ Adaptable to factors from external/internal environment
■ Competitive advantage, unique characteristics are sustainable
■ Constantly seeks to improve by generating/implementing innovative ideas
■ Analyses current and future audiences, clients, stakeholders, potential sources of
funding, revenues for sales
■ Critical zones, possible risks, mitigation strategies are considered
● Strategic planning appropriate when:
○ Operating well but unclear about priorities in 5 years
○ Major economic, political, social changes in environment
○ Constantly striving for financial support, struggle to maintain
○ Constantly losing members, supporters, clients
○ Decreased levels of motivation among staff
○ Uncertain how to balance programming with marketing and fundraising
● Strategic planning may not work when:
○ Lacks leadership
○ Management team does not have necessary skill, nor financial means
○ Key managers/stakeholders do not support idea
○ Lack of commitment
○ Squeezed by daily tasks = no time, resources
○ Intend to strategic plan only for presentation purposes but never want to implement it
4. Approaches and methods of strategic planning: the people factor
● The choice of a method for elaboration of a strategic plan for an arts organisation depends on
several key factors:
○ Type of organisation
○ Field of art in which organisation operates
○ Size of organisation
○ Leadership capacities of key managers in organisation
○ Previous experience in planning
○ Level of partnership and collaboration
● Most commonly used methods:
○ Goal-oriented planning: ‘Inside-out planning’
■ action oriented
○ Extravert planning: ‘Outside-in’ planning
■ based on feedback
■ Popular for networks, associations
○ Problem-based planning
■ Starts with diagnoses of issues
○ Project-based planning
■ Popular among nonprofit and small arts organisations
○ Business portfolio planning
■ Understanding the positioning of a company’s product in relation to their market
attractiveness and competitive strength
● People factors
○ People create organisations, make them work, manage the process of change, create
problems, solve problems
○ Support and commitment from all personnel is important
○ Several ways to elaborate a strategic document:
■ Team within organisation, board, artistic director, executive manager, external
consultant
■ In large organisations = artistic leader, general manager, chair of board are included
in planning group
● Involving the Board
○ In non-profit and state-subsidized arts organisations there is a top management body
(board)
○ Main responsibilities/tasks of board:
■ Policy-making
■ Organisational supervision
■ Specific operational involvement
○ Member of board:
■ Professionals = curators, art critics, lawyers ...
■ Wealthy individuals or representative of corporations = financing, fundraising
■ friends/volunteers = believe in mission
■ Key members of the staff
○ level /scope of involvement that board and personnel have in the process:
■ Top-down approach
● Directive, authoritarian
● Board, artistic director, manager decide on the plan while staff implements it
● Staff motivation might decrease
■ Bottom-up approach
● Democratic management involving the whole personnel
● Board = monitor, coordinate, facilitate
■ Mixed approach
● Combination of two
● Overall strategic guidance
● Personnel participate in consultation process to provide comments, ideas
● Widely used in arts organisation
■ Matrix approach
● Small, emerging nonprofit organisations
● A small team is involved in all stages of strategic planning
● No subordination but horizontal, networking-type relations
● Involving an External Consultant
○ Benefits:
■ Can see issues impossible to identify from inside
■ Neutral role
■ Objective opinion
○ Key areas:
■ Define key strategic issues
■ Gather, analyse data
■ Look at overall context of operation
■ Meeting stakeholder, listening, summarizing diverse opinions
■ Providing alternative solutions
■ Conducting strategic planning sessions with board, key personnel, external experts
■ Securing feedback
■ Elaborating the plan
5. The plan: an overview
● Strategic documents are hypothetical guidebooks, desirable predictions
● Based on an analysis of the current situation and a vision of future achievements
● Starting point for all management functions
● A well-elaborated plan usually answers the following key questions:
○ What are we going to do? What are the aims/objectives?
○ How much, at what quality level and quantity?
○ Why?
○ For whom?
○ Where?
○ How?
○ With what means?
○ Who?
○ When?
○ What results?
6. Types of plans
● Entrepreneurial Plans
○ By people who like to start their own business in the field of arts or creative
(entertainment) industries
○ Based on well-defined idea, exploit market opportunity
○ Entrepreneurs = take risks, deal with uncertainties
○ Structure:
■ Elaboration of idea, its uniqueness, market chances
■ Profile of manager/team = capacities, competences
■ Industry, market analysis = evidence for window of opportunity and future trends
■ Marketing section
■ Functional sectional showing how resources will be secured/developed
■ Evidence for sustainability
■ Contain elements of innovation for growth and expansion
● Business plans:
○ Aims at improving company’s competitiveness, conquer new niche, more clients, implement
innovative ideas
○ Main document for growth and expansion
○ Innovative character
○ Covers all functional areas of management
○ Always oriented towards generating profits and a return on initial investments
● Managerial plans:
○ Main instrument for starting a new organisation or effectively managing existing one
○ In major restructuring process or key changes in activities
○ Can be strategic plan (3-4 years), operational (around 1 year), specific functional (for
concrete departments)
○ Need to maximize results through more effective utilization of resources
● Action plans:
○ Created to identify/elaborate activities/results, responsible individuals, interim results,
deadlines = required to complete a certain task
○ Short-term plans
○ Part of project or complex plans
7. Projects and plans in the arts
● Projects as a means to develop ideas in comprehensive, logical way in order to apply to a
foundation or government programme for grants, attract partners, convince supporters, present
what a team plans to do
● Characteristics of a project:
○ Sequence of well-defined and logically connected activities over a certain period of time,
targeted well, generating concrete results
○ Problem-solving technique = social, problems, educate audiences, increase visibility,
improve cooperation; use innovation/creativity to support causes
○ Improve organisation’s performance and recognize the workflow
● Typical project in arts and culture:
○ Idea
○ Involve people, define responsibilities
○ Creative characteristics
○ Has deadlines in a limited period of time
○ results/deliverables
○ Variety of funding sources
○ Takes risk factors into consideration
● Programme = multiple projects combined under one theme to achieve benefits for the organisation
● Projects differ from strategic plan:
project Strategic plan
short-term long-term
Elaborated to be implemented/terminated Aim to help organisation to survive, develop
Element of strategic plan Help identify organisation’s capacity,
resources, necessary for implementing
projects
Envisage concrete results, success indicators
to evaluate implementation of projects
Reflect on one concrete area of activities Complex documents = have
strategic+functional part
Consist of aims, activities, target groups, action
plan, expected results
More complex structure
Consider environment important context
within which activities take place
Reflects on complex interactions between
organisation and environment
Outcomes are well defined, unique, closely
related to implementation of idea
Concentrate in achieving long-term
objectives
● Similarities:
○ Elaborate to help overall management and decision-making
○ Three main phases:
1. Preparation: conceptualization, analysis
2. Implementation: implementation, development, monitoring
3. Evaluation: control, feedback, undertaking corrective measures
○ Basic questions: what, why, how, for whom, where, when, how much
○ Useless if not implemented
● Intrapreneurial Projects:
○ Main characteristics:
■ Elaborated within organisation setting
■ Focus on innovation, newness, differences
■ Aim to bring revenues
■ Look at market adaptation of artistic creation, creative products, look for
opportunities to create future needs and lead audiences’ tastes
■ Result of brainstorming, focus groups, ‘thinking beyond’ the box exercises
■ motivate/inspire, amount of freedom/responsibility
■ Higher degree of risk
■ Increase staff’s motivation = greater freedom and flow of ideas; requires
intrapreneurial climate and strong strategic leadership
● International Collaborative Projects:
○ Popular and widely used in arts world
○ Stimulate professional development, creativity, exchange, learning experiences, active
networking
○ conceptualized /realized by organisations and individuals from different countries
○ International arts projects are organized in the form of a consortium between partners =
roles/responsibilities are distributed
○ Mobile, nomadic character, several places
○ motivation/ambition is high
○ Multicultural = cultural differences
○ Potential to reach larger audiences
○ Funding from variety of sources
○ Reasons: trend toward globalisation, need to increase audiences/visibility, collaborative
nature
8. Rationale and structure of a strategic plan
● Reasons for arts organisation to elaborate strategic plan:
○ Help newly registered arts organisation to start activities and envisage existence
○ Conceptualize start-up of new organisation
○ Help evaluate activities, restructure itself
○ Assist growth, expansion
○ stabilize/improve organisation’s health, performance
○ Assist fundraising
○ Attract collaborators, investors, partners
○ Explore ways to increase revenues, maintain sustainable mode
● Introduction:
○ Cover page
■ Name, logo, title of strategic plan, duration, contact details, team, date
finalized/approved, signature, amount of investors/financial support
○ Contents page:
■ Presents whole structure
○ Résumé (1-2 pages for business plan of 20 pages):

○ Mission, vision (socially targeted messages, elements of uniqueness, linked to external
environment, target audience, beneficiaries)
○ SWOT analysis = dynamic tool
○ Objectives = arranged in logical, hierarchically structured framework; reflect/synchronize
activities/processes; little dependency as possible on only external sources
■ Subsidized arts organisations = related to creativity, education, audience
development
■ business/commercial arts organisations = focused on higher revenues, profit,
growth, expansion
● Functional part
○ Elaborate specific functional areas
○ Need synchronization with strategic part
○ Aim to develop practical aspects of management and make it more concrete
○ Interdependence between strategic and functional sections (content, process)
○ Functional sections result from general organisational strategy
● Appendices

Chapter 4 - Strategic Thinking - Vision, Mission and Objectives
1. The importance of organisational identity
● Start-up phase: mission statement, vision and long-term goals
● Identity
○ what messages to convey, how internal visual message fits with internal core values and
reason for existence
○ Values, uniqueness, originality, individuality, overall organisational culture/behaviour
○ Identity expresses its individuality, its visual image, behaviour, the way it communicates
with the external world
○ In phase of strategic thinking = evaluate these and if necessary update/change
○ The mission statement is the core of organisation’s identity, but not the only element
○ Questions to elaborate on identity:
• Who are we, and what distinguishes us from others?
• Why do we exist as an organisation and as a team?
• What makes us different from all other arts organisations in the same field?
• What do we want to be, and what are our ambitions and aspirations?
• What are our basic organisational values and norms?
• What are the key programmes we are working on? What is their uniqueness?
• What is our message to society and to external groups, as well as to our personnel?
• How do we convey this message and communicate with our audiences?
• What kind of key messages do we convey: orally, design-wise and online?
• How do we communicate our differences through all forms of promotion?
○ Main elements: p.60
■ Mission (purpose) = statement of reason of existence (uniqueness, impact, historical
role)
■ Vision = imaginary picture of desired future
■ Logo = graphic element presents organisation
■ Values (organisational) = common beliefs, acceptable standards which govern
behaviour within organisation
■ Slogan = motto, phrase (combining keywords), represent benefits of organisation’s
products/services for the clients
2. Vision, Mission and organisational values
● Mission statement target: clients, customers, audiences (needs); external stakeholders (support);
society (open systems); people in organisations (shared values)
● Mission mirrors current events and reflects the future
○ Many arts organisations operate without carefully defining mission= leads to lose focus
○ Mission statements have to be open towards the external environment
○ Mission statements:
- Active, open verbs, expressing relations
○ Non-profit arts organisation
- Addresses specific problem in society and the need to solve it
- Serves as source of motivation for managers, staff, volunteers, stakeholders
- Feeling of involvement
- Common purpose
○ State-subsidized arts organisation
- Connected with overall cultural policy directions in country, region, city
- Preservation of cultural heritage/traditions, promotion of important
artistic/cultural achievements from the past
○ business -oriented arts organisation
- Emphasizes relationship between organisation and customers
- Competitive advantage
- Focuses on main directions of expansion, growth
● Mandate = about social purpose for existence, what the organisation should do
● Vision targets mainly the future
○ What the organisation could achieve if it follows the mission
○ Should be: imaginative, short, understandable, passionate, match the mission, draw a path
to advancement and progress
● Mission and vision can also include organisation values = common beliefs, standards, norms
(examples, p.63)
3. Organisation’s name, logo and slogan
● Logo :
○ Motto, phrase
○ Represents benefits of organisation’s products, services
○ Combines name and graphic image = symbol
○ Visual expression of identity
○ Different symbols, signs, texts, pictures, colours …
○ Simple and easy to recognise
○ Provoke imagination, perception
○ Important part of promotional, communicational materials
● Name:
○ Should be: unique, short, expressive, connected with activities, translatable, Easy to
pronounce/understand, positive, open
● Slogan:
○ Corporate motto
○ Short, memorable phrase consisting of few words which aims to impress and stress
important areas of identity and benefit of products/services
○ Directed to customers, audiences, clients to attract them and increase sales
○ However, not a common practice in arts organisations
- Because final outcome is often not a product
4. Objectives: the three-dimensional framework
● Quantitative and/or qualitative expression of desired outcome
● Questions: what, how much, by what means, when?
● Guidelines as all levels in all areas
● Based on:
○ analysis of the organisation’s or project’s potential (available resources and ability for
growth);
○ the results of market research (if any);
○ the results of analyses of the external environment and external capacity and operations,
and the fit of these results with the chosen strategies; and
○ deep knowledge of all processes and units within the organisation or of all phases in a
project’s development.
● Elaborate objective in three-dimensional framework:
○ Hierarchy of objectives
■ Division into sub-objectives (main objectives, functional objectives, specific
objectives)
○ Whom they target
■ External objectives = towards stakeholders, customers, audience
■ Internal objectives = towards organisational development, help embrace
organisational values, motivate staff
○ Measurability of objectives
■ Economic objectives = measurable, related to figures, quantities, concrete
parameters (financial, non-financial)
■ Social objectives = quantity indicators, towards organisational development, solving
social problems
5. How to set smart objectives
● SMART approach to set objectives: (examples p.71)
○ Specific = concrete, detailed, oriented towards action, straightforward, express exactly what
will happen with whom for whom and with what outcomes
○ Measurable = if you cannot measure the objective, you cannot manage it; track progress;
quantitative and qualitative objectives
○ Achievable and realistic = reachable objectives
○ Timely = concrete deadlines
6. Example of a ‘mission, vision and objectives’ selection of a strategic plan
• Vision
• Mission (Purpose)
• Organisational values (if not included in the mission)
• Logo and slogan (optional)
• Strategic objectives:
- Main
- Functional
- Specific and operational objectives (forming the action plan for the first year)
- Values (optional)
- Other key elements of organizational identity and culture (optional)
Chapter 5 - strategic analysis: the arts organisation and its environment
1. Strategic analysis: an overview
● environment/context = factors which are outside of an arts organisation but influence its resources
(input), processes, outcomes (results)
● (mirco) external environment
○ Direct influence
○ Analysis of industries (their potential, changes in future, possible responses, competition)
○ Analysis of market (market’s size, growth, segmentation, potential audiences, competitors)
● Macro external environment
○ Indirect influence
○ Political, legislative, economic, social, technological, informational, global factors
○ Opportunities or restrictions
○ Analysis of cultural policy framework
● Internal environment
○ Artistic programmes, management methods, organisational culture, structures, policies,
resources, capacity
○ SWOT analysis
2. Understanding and analysing the macro-external environment
● Macro external factors affect organisational strategies and decision-making in indirect way
○ PEST (political, economic, social, technological)
○ Economic factors:
■ cultural/artistic development depends on economic development in a country
■ Regulate to certain extent cultural participation and consumption
■ facilitate/restrict philanthropy, sponsorship individual spending, government
support for arts
■ Most important influencing factors:
- Overall economic situation (growth, stability, recession, deflation, inflation)
- Purchasing power of population
- Relationships with financial institutions
- Currency exchange rates
- Level of employment/unemployment
- Patterns of privatization and their reflection in culture sector
■ Participation and economic development are not directly influenced = attendance
does not drop significantly in crisis
■ Analysis of economic factors:
- What are the overall long-term economic trends in the country (region)?
- What economic trends influence the specific artistic or cultural field?
- What is the long-term prognosis for the main economic parameters?
- What is the overall development forecast for cultural industries?
- How does consumption of cultural goods and services change over time, and
how is it related to economic indicators in a country or region?
- How might the relationships between an arts organisation and its main
external stakeholders and audiences change in the long term under the
influence of economic factors?
- What are the capacities and attitudes of the business sector with respect to
investing in the arts and supporting artistic projects and initiatives?
- What are the economic conditions facilitating (or preventing) international
cultural cooperation, export and import of cultural goods and services or
mobility of artists?
- What are the economic conditions facilitating (or preventing) innovations in
the arts?
○ Political and legislative factors
■ General policy trends, instruments, methods, taxation policy, labour legislation,
overall political situation
■ Important part of all political factors is legislation affecting the arts and culture
sector:
- Specialized laws in different arts/culture categories
- Copyright law and intellectual property law
- Legislation for establishment/functioning of nonprofit organisations
- Legislation for establishment of various types of cultural foundations
- Legislation for sponsorship and donations from individuals and institutions
- Legislation providing benefits for art businesses
- Regulations for the export and import of cultural goods, services, people,
material objects needed for artistic processes; artistic mobility
- Support for arts education, training
- Support mechanisms for cultural participation
- Protection of cultural heritage
○ Social factors:
■ Demographic, cultural, educational matters, traditions, habits, ethnicity, religion
■ Influences trends, consumption, choice of marketing strategies
■ Traditional social structures: families, schools, community organisations
■ Media = important influence
■ Trends that should be monitored/analysed in strategic analysis:
- Socio-economic characteristics of population
- Geographical distribution of population
- Birth, death rates
- Literacy level
- Ethnic mix
- Average family size
- Professional career attitudes
- Lifestyle trends
- Language spoken
- Social networks
- Level of development and usage of internet
- Historical development of arts sector
- Main traditions, customs in society
- Consumption patterns of cultural goods and services
- Acceptable gender roles and occupations
- intellectual , artistic, leisure-time pursuits
- Immigrants, diaspora groups
○ Technological, digital and informational factors
■ Constant implementation of new technologies, online tools changes the arts world
rapidly
■ New virtual, digital context for arts organisations
■ Audience behaviour changes (easy to give feedback, share opinion)
■ Changes the understanding of what art is, who the artist is
■ Digital environment requires a new approach in art management practice and in the
overall strategic planning process
■ Digital, technical, information/communication opportunities:
- Free or low-cost promotion, offering of artistic products and services online
- Real-time communication with audiences
- Ongoing involvement of users in artistic process or feedback through social
media
- Personalized delivery of content
- New ways of fundraising online
- The ease with which to raise awareness
- Ability to overcome distance between artist and audience
- Promotion of artists or artworks based on users’ rating
- E-commerce possibilities
○ Global factors
■ Globalization influences production, circulation, consumption of cultural goods
■ New marketing opportunities, more opportunities for sharing
information/knowledge, for collaboration, co-productions, touring, mobility of
artists
■ Exploring issues of global concerns opens window for many social entrepreneurship
projects
■ Problem: maintaining artistic uniqueness, preserving cultural heritage
○ Environmental natural factors:
■ Energy saving and global warming:
■ Scarcity of natural resources (water, metals, oil, etc.);
■ Increased energy costs from traditional sources of energy (oil, coal, natural gas);
■ Global warming and constantly increasing carbon emissions from burning fossil
fuels;
■ Pollution and the implementation of recycling programmes, ecologically friendly
production technologies and ecologically clean packaging for materials and goods.
○ Occasional (accidental) factors:
■ difficult/impossible to predict
■ Related to war, terrorism, weather effects, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods)
3. Cultural policy as an element of the external environment
● How the overall cultural policy development influences the practice of managing a concrete arts
organisation
● direct/indirect government measures, methods, instruments, used to encourage, develop, protect
cultural heritage, cultural, artistic organisations, activities, projects, individual artists
● Cultural policy as one of the key factors of macro-external environment
● Public good = there is a need for all to share it, protect and preserve for future generations
● Cultural policy analysis covers issues related to:
○ general principles, mechanisms and dilemmas of direct and indirect state support for the
arts;
○ international, national, regional and local cultural policies;
○ government incentives for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the arts;
○ encouragement of arts education;
○ employment in the culture sector
○ relationships between arts organisations and external financing and funding institutions
● Key questions/dilemmas:
○ Is the emphasis on direct or indirect government support for the arts or both?
○ Are policy instruments targeting national-level (and federal-level) arts organisations or also
high quality and innovative nonprofit and commercial art forms through project subsidies?
○ How is state funding distributed between the centre and the periphery—between larger
cities and provinces, as well as isolated regions or towns?
○ Is state support directed only to traditional and classical art forms, or are contemporary
arts organisations also eligible for state funding?
○ How are the state subsidies distributed between well-established arts organisations with a
long history of existence and emerging artistic organisations?
○ What is the form of direct state funding: provision of part of the budget of arts
organisations, or subsidies based on project submissions, or support for individual artists?
○ Is arts education well balanced with the demands of the labour market in the arts and
cultural field, and how do policies help with that?
○ How is it possible to foster artistic creativity through policy decisions?
○ Is there any support for arts organisations that have an intrapreneurial profile?
● Three main models of cultural policy:
1. A. Model of Primarily Government Support for the Arts
● State is main financial source
● Centralized administration and management leads to danger of censorship and
direct involvement of state
● Diversity, mobility, flexibility is minimal
● Nonprofit, business types do not exist
● Arts organisations are relatively stable, enjoying ongoing annual financial support
● No direct link between state subsidies and final quantitative results from cultural
activities. Support is given irrespective of number of participants in cultural event
● Arts markets are non-existent or undeveloped
● Size of audience have little influence on organisation’s development
● Strategic plans at organisational level are predetermined
2. B. Model of Arts and Culture Development Based on Market Principles
● State support for creative work mainly indirect - through legislative framework,
direct state subsidies are minimal
● Three sectors of economy - state, private, nonprofit (commercial, business arts
organisations prevail)
● Majority of revenues/projects come from self-generated revenues, selling products,
services
● Artistic mobility, exchange = high
● Arts/cultural markets well developed, intermediaries are important
● Consumer choices lead and predetermine creative policies and overall
decision-making (programming fits the taste)
● Differences in salary and income levels of individual artists are significant
● Business plans for arts organisations are common
3. C. Mixed Model
● The funding scheme for the majority of cultural organisations and projects is
mixed—coming from the state, business companies, individual donors, foundations
and other financial institutions, as well as from self-earned income.
● The state supports arts and culture with both direct subsidies and indirect
instruments through legislative and other initiatives.
● Together with state-subsidized arts organisations, there is a well-developed art
market, especially in larger cities.
● Creative (cultural) industries are well developed and contribute to the overall
economic development of a country.
● The third sector in the arts and culture (civil society sector) is powerful and
influences the decision-making process at all levels—national, regional, local and
international—through lobbying and advocacy actions.
● The diversity of art forms and arts organisations is very high. The financial models
of the majority of arts organisations are mixed—including both self-earned income
and support from various institutions and individuals.
● The price levels of offered arts products and services vary between state-subsidized
and business organisations. Prices are usually much higher in commercial arts
projects organisations that rely mainly on sales, merchandising schemes and
entrepreneurial projects.
4. Understanding and analysing the micro-external environment: industry and market analysis
● Organisations need to be in constant contact with environment = establish long-term relationships
that provide financial support for future
● Maintain, develop contacts with all groups which form its micro environment
● Three main areas to analyse the micro environment
1. Analysis of creative (cultural, entertainment, leisure) industries’ development and trends
2. Analysis of market factors: competitors, audiences
3. Stakeholder analysis
4.1 Creative (cultural) industries, entertainment industries
● Industry = related to mass production, large quantities, profit
● Cultural industries = producing, distributing cultural goods and services
○ Experimental character
○ Small producers, large establishments
○ Stimulate experimental reactions
○ Subject to competitive and organisational pressures
● Analysis of creative/cultural industries helps to identify:
○ Potential chances for a new entrepreneurial idea
○ Level of difficulty in starting up new organisation
○ Capital, labour, knowledge, other resources to start
○ Driving, restraining industry forces which will influence
○ Direct, indirect competitors
○ Potential partners, collaborators
○ Potential sources of innovations
○ Options for partnership
● There is no agreed framework on what exactly creative/cultural industry branches include
● Entertainment industry = fill people’s free time, enjoy their after-work hours, mass quantities
○ Divided into branches (subsections):
○ creative/artistic (film, music, antiques, architecture)
○ Based on broadcasting, involving media (cinema, video, radio, tv)
○ Using online, digital entertainment (computer games)
○ Live entertainment, outdoor forms (festivals, carnivals)
○ Not directly connected to arts (sports, catering, gambling)
● Kaiser & Kaiser = 5 industry participant categories: peer companies, new entries, substitute
products, buyers, suppliers
4.2 Market Analysis
● Important part of micro-environment
● Three main aspects:
1. Analysis of market size (potential audiences, international expansion), growth (trends in
changing demands), segmentation (potential audiences, clients)
2. Analysis of competitors (direct = similar products/services; indirect = compete for free
time, money of the public)
3. Analysis of suppliers, sources of support (sources of financing, labour market)
4.3 stakeholder analysis
● Important for public and nonprofit arts organisations because their strategic objectives are open to
external groups and one their primary long-term goals is to satisfy key stakeholders
● A stakeholder is defined as any external or internal person, group or organization who influences
(or might influence in the future) the organisation’s performance and outcomes and/or who can be
affected by the organisation’s actions, resources or outcomes.
● Stakeholder analysis identifies key persons and groups and their relationship with the organisation
● Five main steps in analysis:
○ Identification of stakeholders
○ Identification of how stakeholders influence the organisation
○ Identification of what the organisation needs from each stakeholder
○ Identification of the criteria used by the stakeholders in evaluating the organisation
○ Ranking of stakeholders in a rough order of importance
● Concrete results:
○ List of key stakeholders
○ Their main competences, attitudes
○ Level of scope of their influence
○ Possible approaches to involve them in long-term development
○ Possible benefits for stakeholders in long term
5. Understanding and analysing the internal environment
● End result of internal analysis is to indicate the organisation’s capability and flexibility to cope with
the changing external environment and to handle the chosen strategy
● Important to identify:
○ Internal strength used in the future to lead audiences’ tastes, cope with competitors, satisfy
stakeholders’ expectations or generate additional incomes
○ Internal weaknesses to be diminished
○ Capacity of the team
○ Capability of organisation to grow, maintain
○ Elements of intrapreneurial climate
○ Sources and methods to generate, implement innovative ideas
5.1 functional approach
● Based on an evaluation of all functional areas of managing:
○ Artistic and curatorial programmes and creative activities
○ Human resource management
○ Technologies, information systems and operations
○ Marketing and communication
○ Finances
5.2 resource-based approach
● Based on an evaluation of the strength and weaknesses of all available resources needed to perform
an organisation’s activities, their quality and quantity:
○ Human resources
○ Material resources
○ Financial resources
○ Information and non-material resources
5.3 mixed approach
● Combines soft (people, teams, behaviour) and hard (structures, technologies, methods) aspects of
management = evaluation based on:
○ Resources (people, materials, technology, financial, informational, non-tangible)
○ Processes, activities (artistic processes, marketing, management, technical, operational,
financial, functional areas)
○ Structure, people, management procedures (organisational structures, internal procedures,
key managers, leadership)
○ Performance, visibility (indicators, monitoring, results, organisational culture, image)
6. Preparing to define a strategy: critical success factors
● external/internal analysis is to identify the driving (opportunities through environment or
organisation’s strength) and restraining forces (threats)
● Results from SWOT analysis:
○ Formulating mission, objectives
○ Evaluate business idea
○ Identify most suitable organisational, functional strategies
○ Develop, implement innovative programmes, activities products, services
○ Managing changes in human resources
○ Elaborate efficient financial strategies
○ Undertake strategic changes in marketing tools, methods
● Theoretical options resulting from SWOT analysis:
○ Strength
○ Opportunities
○ Weaknesses
○ Threats
● Critical success factors:
○ Areas where management has to pay much higher attention so that the organisation
performs successfully in a competitive environment
○ Example: ongoing engagement of stakeholders, quality of exhibitions, reputation of artist,
public transparency, community outreach
7. Example of a SWOT analysis section of a strategic plan
Chapter 6 - choice of strategies
1. What is a strategy, and why is it important in the arts?
● Strategy comes from military operations and the deceiving of an enemy
● Strategy is about: framework which guides the choices; set of decision over time designed to
achieve specific goals and objectives; plan, ploy, pattern, position, perspective; positioning an
organisation for sustainable competitive advantage; determination/evaluation of alternatives in
achieving objectives; goal-directed; a way; an approach; a direction to long-term objectives
2. Classification of strategies
● Strategy formulation results from strategic analysis and the organisational values, mission,
objectives
● Strategic portfolio = set of chosen strategies that could correspond to many existing possibilities
● Main organisational strategies:
○ Ways to solve main problems, main road map
○ For intensive growth, ascending, advancing strategies
○ For stability
○ For survival
○ Privatization strategies, change in ownership, overall legal status
○ Capacity-building strategies
● Artistic programme strategies:
○ Core of every arts organisation
○ Clarify what an organisation is going to change
○ Guide an organisation on how to be more proactive in creating and promoting artistic
programmes and help determine what resources will be required
○ Cultivating creative teams
○ Especially important for subsidized arts organisations and non-profit
○ Programme (product) development, concentrated and conglomerate diversification,
focusing = most common product strategies
● Market and competitive strategies:
○ Help to concentrate on achieving a sustainable competitive advantage, increasing sales,
satisfying audiences’ tasted and improving the organisation’s visibility
○ Most popular market strategies: market development, market penetration, competitive
strategies
● Functional strategies:
○ About further development of important functional areas
● Group strategies in relation to an organisation’s level of adaptation to the external environment
1. Aggressive strategies = implement changes quickly, widen market opportunities
2. Protection strategies = stabilize against external threats
3. Counter-attack strategies = need to correct mistakes
4. Perceptive strategies = research into external/internal environment, look for flexible
adaptation of methods used by others
5. Mixed strategies = combination
3. Main organisational strategies
● Several options resulting from SWOT analysis:
○ Intensive growth
○ Strategy of stability
○ Innovation strategies
○ Survival strategy
1. Innovation strategies:
- Applicable to many aspects
- New products, new management models, new communication channels…
- Newness leading to effectiveness
2. Spin-off (outsourcing) strategies
- Part of activities would be better positioned in a new entity
- When an organisation outsources its entire production, operations, or part of it, to another
organisation
3. Privatization strategies
- Predetermined by the overall cultural policy directions in a country
- In cultural industries much easier than in traditional arts sector
- Aims: to provide greater autonomy, more flexible style of operations, increase funding via
sponsorship, raising entrance feeds, motivate entrepreneurial thinking
- Fears: commercial shift, disappearance of direct state control, loss of traditional arts forms
or cultural heritage
4. capacity -building strategies
- Considered one of the main organisational strategies
- Overall transformation based on improving its own capacity and resources
- Results from a substantial process of training and learning
- Especially important for countries in transition = turbulent environments, changing
economic, political systems
- Aims: change people’s skills, competences, knowledge, implement new management tools to
cope with a turbulent environment
5. Survival strategies
- Where there is a misfortune situation of coincidence of organisational weaknesses and
external threats
- Tendencies which predict a forthcoming crisis: drop in public attendance/sales; large
increase in indirect costs for administration/maintenance; constant complaints, negative
feedback; large increase in taxes, loans, insurance policies; inability to pay back debts;
defaults and problems of payments on contracts
- Internal reasons = inefficient management, difficulties in functional areas, long-term
tendencies towards crisis management
- External reasons = strong competitors, economic recession, withdrawal of subsidy, high
inflation, governmental changes, national disasters = beyond control but strategic thinking
helps to survive
- Strategies for increasing revenues = implementation of new projects, persistent and focused
fundraising, sale of part of organisation’s assets, innovative approaches towards
self-generated income
- Strategies for decreasing expenditures = analysis of whole cost structure, subsequent cuts of
inefficient costs, decreases in indirect costs for administration/maintenance, reduction of
waste, cuts of staff benefits, sales of properties, equipment, delays in payment, increases in
‘in-kind’ contributions
6. Liquidation (bankruptcy) strategies
- Serious problems of all kinds
- Aims: secure a time period for returning some of the losses and debts and eventually finding
a way to restart operations after a certain time
4. Strategies for integration, cooperation and networking
● Main organisational strategies:
1. Integration strategies
● Acquire, merge, supervise with another organisation in the same sector that
produce similar products or those that act as suppliers or distributors in the
economic chain
● Horizontal integration = similar processes, products
● Vertical integration = deal mainly with creative production process merges with
suppliers or distribution company
2. Partnership strategies
● Combining efforts and expertise to achieve greater results, to enable the
dissemination of good practices, to jointly increase public image, audience interest,
develop high-quality artistic programme
● Within one art sector = e.g. between theatres
● Cross-sectoral = between different arts and culture sectors; between cultural and
other sectors (tourism, education…)
● Consortiums = partnership for joint work on a project; pooling resources to achieve
a common goal
● Joint ventures = between 2 companies, usually business world; for setting up
another company
3. Creative cluster strategies
● Geographical concentration of organisations in the creative (entertainment)
industries
● Organisations pool resources and look at ways to optimize the overall production
and dissemination chain of creative works
● Leads to long-term partnerships
● Contributes to local development
● Strengthen communities
● Open environment of ongoing exchange of innovative ideas
4. Co-production strategies
● When 2 or more organisations or groups of artists create and artistic work together
● Share risk, use strength of each, diminish weaknesses
● Distribution of profit depends on signed agreement between partners
5. Networking strategies
● Cultural and artistic networks are dynamic systems of communication, cooperation,
exchange, partnership
● Horizontal relations, informal nature, democratic, open way, flexible, easily formed
● Artistic mobility, creates platforms for sharing information, spaces for
laboratory/experimental thinking
● Creative clusters = applied mainly in creative industries, to achieve higher
effectiveness, primarily local level
● Cultural networks = nonprofit sector, can be national or international
● Problems:
- Entry barriers = membership fees may cause disadvantage to join
- Internal networking competition
- Internal operations and management = growth leads to loss of focus
- Sustainability = networks can disappear easily
- Long-term results = no immediate results
● Requirements for effective elaboration and implementation of networking
strategies:
- Define added value, expected results
- Choose geographical area
- Focus on dynamic exchange, establishment of learning environment
- Stimulate cross-sectoral networking strategies
- Consider strategies and models for online networking
6. Lobbying strategies:
● Aimed at expressing common interests and influencing decision-making, usually
government authorities
● Commonly used in nonprofit culture sector
● Time-consuming strategy
● Broad international support, vertically integrated
5. Product (programme)-market strategies
● Aim to achieve high-quality standards in the professional domain while, at the same time, gaining
wide audience participation
● Product-market strategies are also called programme-market strategies in the arts (because often,
the programme is adapted)
● Tool that is used in management practice to help businesses decide on their product and market
growth strategies: Ansoff’s Matrix (p.132)
○ It suggests that a business can grow in one of four ways that range from low risk to high risk
○ This choice is based on
■ Identification of the types, quantity and quality of products
■ Their marketability (sales possibilities)
○ 4 ways of growth
■ Market penetration strategies
● Strategy for growth whereby an organisation focuses on producing and
offering an existing product in existing markets
● Opportunity to increase quality of products and services for regular clients
● Also called ‘business as usual’
● Potential problem: might be focused too much on one product
● Conventional use of production and distribution methods
■ Market development strategies
● Seek new markets for existing products and services (seeking new
geographical markets of new market segments for the same creative
programme)
● Require investments in new distribution channels and changes in pricing
policy
● Threat: same as market penetration str.: offering only one product without
alternatives
■ Product (programme) development strategies
● New creative (core) programmes to existing audiences or customers
● +: keeping current audiences while, at the same time, attracting new ones
● No huge risks/investments
■ Diversification strategies
● Enriching the core activities of an organisation and/or increase the variety
of offers (programmes and services)
● Seeks to increase revenues and profit through sale of new products to new
market segments
● Threat: could lead to loss of focus because of too many new products
● Involves high level of uncertainty because of entry to new market
● 2 main diversification strategies
○ Concentric diversification: organisation continues its core activities
but develops new products and services as well which are connected
with main programme → targets new clients
○ Conglomerate diversification: new products and services are not
connected to usual core product → useful when revenues should be
increased; BUT could also lead to distraction from thee main
programme
● Defining the product portfolio: background for product-market strategies
○ Evaluation of market potential of a product and elaboration of product portfolio is
important
○ Analysis of product life cycle (which phase of the product life cycle the product
(programme) is in) (scheme, p.135)
■ Introduction: when sales commence; usually financial losses at the start; high
percentage of risk and unpredictability of customer’s behaviour; suitable for market
penetration strategy
■ Growth: rapid sales increase, cultivation of new market segments, consideration of
new distribution channels, rapid increase in profit and possibility of price-decrease
strategies; competition begins to increase; suitable for market development and
product (programme) development strategies
■ Maturity: focus on prolongation of maturity; phase of reaching target audience and
stabilizing sales and prices; competitive offers are usually increased; suitable for
innovation or diversification strategies
■ Decline: could occur because of appearance of better products, changing customer
preferences and need to implement new technologies; sales volume decline; design
of new/change of old product need to be planned
○ → strategic choices are possible for each product individually
○ In arts environment, this cycle needs to be used with care because the product, quantity and
revenues are not always focus of results
○ Useful monitoring tool
6. Competitive strategies
● Competitive advantage
○ An organisation’s ability to perform at a higher level than others in the same industry or
market
○ Covers key things which make an organisation better than its competitors
○ Research on competitors needs to be conducted to discover the competitive advantage of an
organisation: strategic and operational research
● Benchmarking
○ Process of researching and applying the best practice which leads to the best results → not
looking at all competitors but only at the ones that do better than you (actual market leader
is difficult to define in art world)
● Porter’s generic strategies model for assessing and analysing the competitive strength and position
of a business organisation
○ Cost leadership strategies
■ Main aim: secure a competitive advantage through lower cost (or higher subsidies)
→ offering products and services for a lower price than competitors
■ Main areas to look at when re-evaluating and decreasing costs
● Costs, related to purchasing materials and equipments needed to undertake
activities
● Indirect costs
● Costs for marketing and distribution
○ Differentiation strategies
■ Aim: to outline the unique and non-conventional characteristics of the product or
service which are preferred by the target clients or customers and which distinguish
it from those of competitors
■ Emphasis is on satisfying the audience
○ Product (programme) focus strategies
■ Aim_ to identify an area, activity, product or service which is most appropriate in
relation to the organisation’s expertise and resources
■ Requires deep research of market niche and potential audiences
■ Emphasis on: unique characteristics of artistic programming; a non-traditional
approach to production and distribution; the special offer(s) made to targeted
groups
■ Narrow but specialized know-how in a specific production area is required
■ Specialization
● Can occur by: hiring specialized and skilled actors, personnel or contractors;
employing new and innovative technology or methods; pursuing a strong
branding of products; distribution methods engaging audiences
7. Evaluation of alternatives and choice of strategies
● Phase of analysis and evaluation has four substages
○ Generation of strategic alternatives: each alternative is a practical approach for achieving a
goal
○ Evaluation of alternatives: looks at possible barriers and risks for the realization of
alternatives
○ Comparative analysis of alternatives and choice of strategy: choosing the most appropriate
alternative
○ Operational plan for implementation of the strategy: brings strategy into a practical phase
● One of the most popular methods for selection of a strategy is based on the results of the SWOT
analysis (grid, p.140); 4 options for most appropriate strategies
○ When strengths and opportunities prevail: intensive growth, product (programme)
development and product focusing strategies, innovations and differentiation
○ When weaknesses and opportunities prevail: collaborating, joining and integrating to
diminish their weaknesses and use external opportunities; vertical integration,
conglomerate diversification, co-production and capacity-building
○ When strengths and threats prevail: horizontal integration, concentrated diversification,
market penetration and networking
○ When weaknesses and threats prevail: most unfavourable situation
8. Example of a ‘strategies: options and choices’ section of a strategic plan
Chapter 7 - Marketing, Creative Programming and Audience Development Plan
1. Why use marketing in arts organisations
● Marketing defined as:
○ Process
○ To bring mutual satisfaction for customers and company
○ Aim to increase profits; aim for customer: to satisfy needs and expectations
○ Centre of all activities: customer
○ Ongoing communications exchange between company and customer
○ Aims to convey values, influence, change customers’ behaviour
● Developed as a philosophy and practice suggesting that understanding the needs of customers and
building long-term relationships and mutual trust are key to success
● Role of marketing to match the artistic creations with an appropriate audience
● To reach those market segments likely to be interested in the product while adjusting to the
product the commercial variables (price, place, promotion) to put the product in contact with
customers
● Successfully selling a product to a specific audience to increase revenue
● Aspect of marketing in the arts:
○ Leading role of artistic, creative programming
○ Aesthetic, joyful experience for audience
○ Educational aspect
○ Need for social dimension of projects
○ Connection between arts and community engagement
○ Collaborative, networking environment
○ Need to incorporate elements in marketing strategies, tools, both online and offline
● Marketing in the arts is about leading audiences/communities, shaping their tasted and creating
new needs and wants and not simply satisfying existing ones = maintain long-term relationships
● Doubts about using marketing methods in the arts:
○ art/culture should be supported by state, be independent from commercial principles
○ Marketing tools are always commercial = decreases quality of art
○ Art is about creativity, inspiration cannot be limited to pragmatic methods of
sales/distribution
● Why marketing tools are appropriate in the arts:
○ Helps attract audiences in competitive environment
○ Communicates the organisational identity
○ Helps arts projects and initiatives to become more visible
○ Helps to increase external support and additional revenues
○ Strengthen the internal capacity
2. Strategic marketing objectives
● The content of marketing plan focuses on:
1. Audience profile, audience needs, attitudes
2. Competitive advantage and uniqueness, elements of innovation
3. Marketing mix to find out most appropriate ingredients for target audience
4. Outline marketing budget
● Tension between marketing strategies and programme (product) strategies
○ Market about sales/profits
○ Programming about concentrating on quality of products/artistic creation
○ HOWEVER marketing can have different directions/aims
● Main marketing objectives:
○ educate /engage audiences, help them to understand better the core
○ Develop audiences’ tastes, involve them in diverse cultural experiences
○ Increase diverse audience segments’ access to the core programmes
○ Create, improve, change the public image
○ Increase revenues and profits
○ Seek external support
● There is a balance between creative programming and efficient marketing when there is a close
relationship between artistic leader and marketing manager = the board has to ensure this balance
3. Digital Marketing
● Current trends in marketing-related innovations influencing arts organisations:
○ Rapidly expanding role of social media
○ Changing role of audiences, from passive to active
○ Production and offers of more digital content
○ Mobile marketing
○ Co-marketing to boost returns and lower marketing costs
○ Consideration of customers’ attitudes and opinions about products and services
● Digital marketing = promoting products/services using primarily database-driven online
distribution channels to reach consumers
● Internet marketing = products/services offered via internet
● user/online visitor = people who browse website and participate in online social networking sites
● Digital marketing strategies are different because:
○ Interactivity
○ Duration
○ Active user approach
○ Dialogue with and among users
○ Rich content
○ Measurable
○ Adaptable
4. Audience Development strategy
● Main focus of marketing strategies = audience
● Marketing theory distinguishes:
○ Art buyer = purpose of buying goods
○ Customer = buyer who maintains the relationship
○ Art client = pays money to acquire services
○ Attendee = participates and benefits from services
○ Audience = group of people who attend an art experience
○ Community = group of interacting people, sustaining relationship, living in one location,
term used mainly in non-profit organisations’ marketing strategies, high level of interaction,
shared values, beyond participation
4.1 Audience Development Process
● Audience development: mainly associated with the arts and cultural field; to meet the needs of
existing and potential audiences, to also create future needs, to develop ongoing long-term
relationships between organizations and audiences
○ Nonprofits or subsidized organisations: also includes elements of education → audience
outreach
● Potential audience: may have interest in engaging with the arts organizations activities now or in
future
● Occasional audiences: come to an art event not because they are familiar with the art form; lower
than the average rate of attendance
● Regular audiences: visits on regular basis
● Frequent audiences: rate of attendance is higher than the average
● supporters: volunteers, boards members, donors etc. —> develop time and money to develop the
organization further
● Aim: to transform potential audience members into regular audiences and then into supporters
4.2 Online Users
● Global and not located in a specific physical space
● Open market
● Quite critical and anonymous
● Different types
○ Passive users: read online content but do not participate in it
○ Online connectors: staying in contact with others and observe
○ Online collectors: add tags to their photos or web pages
○ Online contributors: give critical opinions, post ratings and reviews
○ Creators of online content: publish their own blogs, open forums etc.
● aim: transforming passive users to creators
5. Audience Research
● Market research: systematic design of surveys and research tools, collection, analysis, reporting and
interpretation of data and findings
● Marketing or market research: are interconnected and often used as synonyms
5.1 Reasons for Audience Research
● Marketing strategies have become more complex and focused and targeted towards specific groups
● Competition among organizations has increased
● Constant scarcity of funding
● Audience have a more selective and demanding behavior than before
● Audiences reflect much more nowadays on the future programming by providing their feedback,
responses and comments, including online
5.2 Research Methods
● Qualitative methods (generally deeper and by smaller respondents)
○ Focus groups
○ Personal in-depth interviews
○ Observations
○ Expert evaluation
● Quantitative methods (large number of respondents)
○ Marketing survey
○ Experiment (test) marketing: experimental production offered to a small market segment to
see how it would be accepted
● Audience survey usually gathers following information
○ Audience profile (age, gender, educational level etc.)
○ Attitude towards the creative programs, products or services
○ Attendance and accessibility
○ Other areas (e.g. interests and preferences about other art forms)
5.3 Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning
● Outcome of audience research: market segmentation —> process of separating the neutral market
into various pieces (segments) of audiences which have similar needs, preferences and models of
market behavior
○ Basic requirements for defining a market segment: segments must be significant, have a
certain size, must contain buyers who respond in similar ways to market offers, stimuli and
pressure, most be relatively stable over time
○ Variable frequently used: age, gender, education etc.
● Targeting: using specific marketing strategies and promotional schemes to fit the tastes, needs and
expectations —> target groups
● Positioning: connected with branding and image-building
6. Marketing Mix Recipe: The four Ps of Marketing
● Most commonly used concept in marketing strategies in the arts
● product, place, price and promotion
● Extended understanding of the marketing-mix concept includes three more Ps: people, processes
and physical facilities
6.1 The First P: program Strategy (creative programming)
● Elaboration of a strategy for further artistic programming (creation of artistic repertoire and new
offers and services
○ Quantity of products and programs (number and frequency of e.g. performances)
○ Quality of programming
● Concept of extended products or services in arts organizations considers three layers
○ Core products and services (actual artistic programming)
○ Additional products and services (closely connected with core products or services and
supplement the core artistic or curatorial process
○ Peripheral products and services (offered in order to generate profit, diverse activities
which are not directly connected to artistic core product, to answer specific needs of
targeted audiences)
● Educational programs
○ Curricular support (implemented in subjects)
○ Artistic working with schools and universities
○ Regular attendance by young people from universities and schools
○ Training young talents
● Branding
○ Making the elements of organization’s identity recognizable by more and more people
○ One way through which the organization can distinguish itself from other organizations
○ Increases audience’s emotional attitude towards a product or a service and motivates them
to return
6.2 The second P: price Strategies
● Well-elaborated price strategy should
○ Motivate audiences
○ Reflect the quality of artistic program
○ Be more appealing than that of the competitors
○ Offer price package and deals in collaborations with other organizations
○ Offer promotional prices to regular audiences, members and subscribers
● Influential factors
○ Type of organization
○ Quality of product and services
○ Demand
○ Collaboration (price packages in partnerships)
● Basic methods for planning prices
○ Cost-based: calculation of direct (connected with production process) and indirect (related
to production process, e.g. administration, insurance etc.) costs
○ Competition-based: identify how competitors are performing and make sure that the prices
for the same products are better or at least not higher; if the organization is dominant in the
market, it could be the price leader
○ Demand-based (or consumer-based): consumers at centre of calculating price; popular for
commercial and business arts organizations, where prices increase when consumers’
requests and attention increase
○ Advanced: higher price based on assumption that the program offered has unique
characteristics and is attracting or inviting —> higher demand
○ Subsidized: subsidy helps to decrease the price (if production costs make a product much
higher than what a consumer could usually afford)
● often, price regulation are offered for certain target groups —> provide wider access
● In online sales and marketing, some costs are drastically decreased (e.g. labour costs)
6.3 The third P: Place (Distribution Strategies)
● Main aspects
○ Physical location where the purchase of a product/event
○ Distribution channels (place where people can buy tickets)
● Commercial location: physical site where the product is bought or consumed
● Physical distribution: all logistics and transportation involved in the process of bringing a product
to the market
● Distribution channels
○ Online and mobile channels
○ Offline channels (agents, organisations etc.)
○ Telephone reservation system
○ Existing distribution chain of a network, association or other organization
○ Direct channels: organization that produces also distributes
○ Indirect channels: other organization than producing one distributes products
(intermediary between production and sales)
● Choice for distribution channel depends on type of organization
6.4 The Fourth P: Promotion (Communication Strategies)
● Communication as part of marketing in an arts organization is directed towards
○ Stimulating cultural demands
○ Differentiating a product or a service from all others
○ Creating or repositioning an organization’s image
○ Involving and engaging audiences
○ Increasing sales revenues
○ Influencing and leading audiences’ tastes
○ Advocating for the role of the arts and culture in the society
● Communication strategy and promotional strategy: used interchangeably BUT promotion is part of
marketing mix and communication is a broader term
● Promotion mix: includes techniques which not only help sell a product or service but also stimulate
future demand
● Advertising
○ Paid form of non-personal communication and aims at presenting and promoting ideas,
goods and services (non-personal because message is presented to general public)
○ Messages are communicated to potential audiences through impersonal media (radio, tv
etc.)
○ Commonly used checklist: AIDA
■ To attract customer’s Attention
■ To get customer’s Interest
■ To create a Desire
■ To motivate an Action
○ Can be conveyed:
■ Offline: through broadcast and press, print materials and outdoor signs
■ Online: uses internet (e.g. website or online tools)
■ Mobile: uses mobile (wireless) phones
○ Marketing mix includes setting up an advertising plan; main steps:
■ Formulating advertising goals:
● Choosing most relevant media channels
● Evaluating the available budget and the organization’s capacity
● Deciding on the format of the message, it’s frequency and repetition
● Preparing the advertising message(s)
■ Public relations (PR):
● Process of maintaining and developing a mutual understanding between the
organisation and its public
● Helps to enhance reputation and set up favourable conditions for future
market interactions
● Tools: press conferences, online newsletter and bulletins, open educational
programmes and seminars, audio-visual materials, press articles, television
and radio presentations, interviews, speeches and special public events
■ Sales promotion:
● Aims at offering various stimuli to audiences and clients to buy higher
quantities during a certain time period or buy them sooner
● Methods: free gifts, discount prices, merchandising, bonuses, lotteries, free
samples, vouchers, coupons, involvement of new media etc.
● Main characteristics: audiences have an easy way to answer; offered benefits
are temporary and have an expiration date; a lengthy process is needed to
prepare and organize the campaign; target groups respond differently to
different offers; costs of implementation are low
● Main group of sales-promotion methods
○ Methods influencing the purchase price: e.g. discount policies,
subscription schemes
○ Methods not directly influencing the purchase price: e.g. discussion
series, special prize draws and bonuses
○ → important to keep it user-friendly and simple
● Direct sales: all methods of direct contact between the salesperson and the
buyer, in which the presented offer aims to provoke an action by the buyer
6.5 Planning the Communication Process
● Several main stages
○ Clarification of target audiences
○ Definition of main communication objectives
○ Creative and design process
○ Selection of the main communication tools → non personalized and personalized (table,
p.180)
○ Designation of the frequency of using different channels
○ Consideration of budget limitations and calculations of costs
○ Review and feedback
7. Creating and Managing an online space
● Important areas of online space
○ Scope and focus: what will the website communicate
○ Unique features: how is it different than other online spaces?
○ Profit versus nonprofit: should the website generate revenue?
○ Dynamic vs static content
○ Technical matters
○ Collaboration: marketing with other organizations?
○ Risk factor
● Main elements
○ Reflects organisation’s identity
○ Focuses and filters the information
○ Shows collaboration and networking
○ Encourages online interaction and critical reflections by users
○ Personalized
○ Contains a lot of visual elements
○ Updated regularly
○ Creates a sense of ownership
○ Is present at several well-known social networking platforms
8. Example of a ‘marketing, creative programming and audience development’ section of a strategic plan
Chapter 8 - Human Resource Management Plan
1. The human resource management system in an arts organisation
● People = most important resource in any organisation
● No single correct way to plan/manage people
● Two levels of planning related to human resources:
1. Strategic
- Covers the development of long-term policies and strategies
2. Operational
- Includes the design, ongoing monitoring and implementation of concrete activities
in all areas of human resource management system
● Human resource management plan helps:
○ Achieve main objectives and optimizing labour costs
○ Attract right people for right jobs = monitoring and improving their competences
○ Generates social effects (living standards, fair salaries, benefits, motivation)
1.1 Elements of a human resource management system
● Human resource covers the first 3 aspects
1. Setting up structure, regulations, procedures
- Evaluate existing organisational structure, ways to improve workflow, decision-making
- Establishing internal procedures, regulations in functional areas
- Setting up board, committee, trustees structures and roles
- Securing conditions for health and safety
- Evaluating the potential of personnel
2. Identifying mechanisms for recruitment and selection of personnel
- Attracting right candidates
- Selecting, contracting personnel
- Designing collective agreements, negotiating with professional unions
- Organizing work schedules
3. Maintaining and developing the professional qualifications of people
- Motivation (salaries, benefits)
- Providing professional training
- Offering individual career development
4. Managing internal dynamics = relates to organisational behaviour
- Leadership and team-building
- Management of conflicts and changes
- Decision-making and problem solving
- Management of diversity and interpersonal communication
1.2 specific features of human resource management in arts organisations
● Specificities in arts organisations in the process of managing people
○ Teams in cultural productions have diverse characters and different levels of involvement
(direct, indirect); workflow is difficult to plan in the creative process → degree of flexibility
is higher
○ Arts sector has high level of specialization (many types of professions) → makes certain
persons ‘irreplaceable’
○ Recruitment of the right people for creative teams does not always follow general rules for
recruitments (time- and resource-consuming process); hard to find the right talent for the
creative production
○ Management of creative processes and management of all other supporting, administrative,
technical and ‘backstage’ activities are usually split at the top management level between
artistic leader and a general manager → decision-making is difficult
○ Most arts organisations work with boards → difficult to create these boards
○ Flexible structures and operate on a project basis
○ Unusual work schedules in some areas → requires careful consideration of general policies
related to working hours and holidays
2. Organisational structures and internal regulations
● Organisational chart (organogram): way a structure of jobs/personnel is described visually;
consists of following elements:
○ Management levels: shows management hierarchy; ‘flat’ vs. ‘fat’ structures
○ Departments and units: departments correspond to the main functional areas of
management such as production, finances, marketing and innovations
○ Co-relations between departments and units
■ Subordination: between departments and positions from different levels
■ Coordination: between departments and positions at the same level
○ Positions (or work posts): each position is for a specific purpose/specific role
2.1 Types of Organisational Structures
● Linear Structure
○ Simple structure with tight hierarchical connections; ‘pyramidal’ form, strongly centralized;
suitable for smaller organisations; head of organisation should be a specialist in all
functional areas (no support from functional personnel)
● Functional structure
○ Popular among middle-sized and large organisations; work is organised around functional
areas (finances, administration, marketing etc.); led by top management
○ Advantage: competences and skill are split; spaces for sharing and collaboration while chain
of command is clear
○ Disadvantage: if too specialized or too big, this structure can become difficult for
communication and coordination between the units and could slow down the
decision-making processes
● Matrix Structure
○ Suitable for projects or project-driven organisations; main focus: teams who work on
specific projects; team members have certain roles and responsibilities; key people take on
various tasks → project costs can be minimized; teams: usually flexible units, can work on
multiple projects
○ In large organisations, this structure can become too complicated
● Sand-clock structure
○ Most arts organisations
○ Board who make major decisions
- Developing policies and strategies or responding to strategies proposed by senior
staff
- Taking overall responsibility for development
- Develop structures and procedures
- Help fundraising and marketing campaigns
- Maintain fiscal responsibility
- Initiate and approve programmes and projects
- Provide support to key managers to perform daily tasks
- Make decisions about hiring and termination of personnel
- Implement assessment and control systems
● Structure facilitating intrapreneurship
○ To stimulate intrapreneurial climate
○ To do this:
- Pyramidal structure into more flexible one = horizontal relations
- Independence and autonomy to some of the key departments and teams
- Set up well-defined objectives as well as resources
- Flexible forms of labour organisation, rotation and exchange = enriches job
descriptions, less specialization
- Connect achieved results with well-elaborated reward system
- Elaborate effective strategy for unity to achieve objectives
- Requires strong leadership
- Team-building approach
2.2 Internal regulations and working conditions
● Help set up internal management technology and operations = the way things are done = guidelines
○ For internal organisation of labour
○ For salaries and benefits
○ For recruitment, evaluation, training and development of personnel
● Working instructions = how to perform a concrete routine and repetitive task
● Working conditions = how taks should be performed and in what physical environment
● Physical working conditions = heating, lighting, noise level, ergonomic, risk factors, hours of work,
degree of repetitiveness
● Social working conditions = working atmosphere, relationships
● Healthy and safety regulations
=> usually determined by national labour legislation in the respective country
● However, artists are a special category that does not conform to mainstream employment
characteristics
● Unique aspects of artists’ working conditions:
○ Unstable nature of work; self-employed
○ Fluctuating incomes
○ Unusual work schedules
○ Unusual retirement ages
3. Analysis and evaluation of personnel’s potential: people and jobs
● Important: evaluate how many and what kind of people are needed to achieve long-term goals; how
many people and with what levels of competencies and skills are needed
● Different dimensions:
○ Elaboration of future needs of human resources
○ Analysis of the available human resources
○ Identification of necessary changes
3.1 Evaluation of the Personnel’s Portfolio
● This provides results that drive decisions on recruitment, training, development, motivation,
repositioning and layoffs (firing)
● The variables for these decisions can change depending on the situation
● Helps the manager to evaluate the human resource potential and needs for additional personnel
3.2 Job Analysis and Job Description
● Job analysis: systematic process that determines the skills, duties and knowledge required for
performing the job; provides questions to following questions
○ Why is the job needed?
○ When does it start/completed?
○ Where?
○ How should it be performed?
○ What qualifications are needed?
● Practical methods used for analysing jobs
○ Observation of how people perform their jobs
○ Questionnaires
○ Regular supervision of job performance
○ Individual interviews
○ Group discussions on job performance
○ Recording of job performances (with hidden or visible camera)
● Job description: list of position’s general tasks, duties and responsibilities as well as qualifications
and skills needed; used when advertising to fill a vacancy (a new position) and for establishing
ongoing performance reviews; tailored to strategic needs of an organisation
4. Finding the right people for the right job: recruitment and selection stages
● Recruitment and selection of personnel: finding right people for right job
● In performing arts, movie business and television shows known as casting
● Planning of main recruitment and selection stages includes:
○ Preparation: carrying out job analysis, writing description and requirements for potential
candidates → results in formulation of a vacancy announcement
○ Deciding on the procedure of selection: setting criteria to choose the right candidates and
selecting a panel
○ Advertising the vacancy: important to identify the most suitable and cost-effective tools and
places for advertising
○ Selection process: actual process of evaluating applications and conducting the interviews;
usually divided into three steps:
■ Selection by documents (cv, cover letter, references etc.)
■ Selection by interviews with short-listed candidates
■ Trial period to assess the qualities and competence of the candidate in a real
situation
○ Ranking and making the selection decision: refers to short-listing the final candidates and
choosing the most appropriate one
○ Informing candidates about the final results: also important to inform the non-selected
candidates
○ Appointing the new staff person(s): making an initial job offer, sending formal letter of
appointment, signing contract, arranging job training and providing relevant information
● Many larger organisations use the services of employment or recruitment agencies to find
employees (saves administration time)
5. Investing in people: motivation, training and professional development
5.1 Why is motivation important?
● Motivation is essential for achieving high performance indicators and job satisfaction at work
● Many theories on the subject of motivation that attempt to answer the question of why and how
human behaviour is activated and how this behaviour can be directed to invest efforts, satisfy need
and reach common goals; most popular ones
○ Hierarchy of needs by Maslow
○ ERG theory by Alderfer
○ Needs theory by McClelland
○ Motivation-hygiene factors theory by Herzberg
○ Cognitive evaluation theory
● Motivation: internal impulse and state that directs people’s behaviour towards achieving certain
organisational goals
● Artist’s motivation is different from motivation in other professions (earning their living is not the
primary drive to produce art)
● Jobs have to motivate people who perform them; theory of what a motivating job actually means by
Hackman and Oldham → 5 characteristics of a motivating job:
○ Skill variety
○ Task identity
○ Task significance
○ Autonomy
○ Job feedback
● Role of arts managers is to constantly evaluate the job positions in an organisational setting and to
create an intrapreneurial climate
5.2 Methods to increase Motivation
● Job rotation: temporary move of a person from one job to another within the organisation → to
allow employees to gain more insights into how other work areas function and a wider view of
overall production and technological process
● Job enlargement and enrichment: aim to either increase the number of tasks performed or broaden
responsibilities and have a higher degree of autonomy in a certain position
● Flexible working hours and forms of labour organisation: provision for unusual working hours
which better fit a person’s habits and daily lifestyle (very popular in arts field)
● Self-managed work teams: heightened degree of freedom and responsibility to an autonomous
team without ongoing direct supervision (one of key characteristics of intrapreneurial units)
5.3 Salaries and Fees
● Important factor of motivation because they secure living standards
● Salaries: money remunerations for performing permanent jobs
● Fees: result from contracted and temporary assignments
● In the majority of cases in the arts field, labour costs comprise the highest percentage of the overall
expenses
● 2 main salary and fee system:
○ Closed payment system: salary and fee levels are based on the financial situation of the
organisation (irrespective of personnel’s and contractor’s expectations, skills or
competencies)
○ Flexible (open) payment system: organisation considers both its own interests and the
interests and expectations of its personnel and contractors
● When one is planning the labour costs, it is important to also calculate allowances (additional
payments):
○ Work or professional experiences
○ Higher qualifications
○ Unusual work times
○ Overtime work
○ Touring
● Bonuses are another monetary motivation and could be calculated
○ As percentage of increased sales or revenues
○ For performing the same amount of tasks in less time
○ For achieving high results in work
○ For innovative ideas and implementation of new projects
○ For effective group work which brings tangible results
5.4 Professional Development and Learning
● Learning organisation (popular for intrapreneurial organisations):
○ Act as open system and learns from external environment
○ Uses people’s mental and creative capacity
○ Facilitates people’s initiatives and the creation of new ideas
○ Stimulates people to learn
○ Encourages experimentation and reasonable level of risk
○ Promotes exchange of information
○ Cares about people, not only about the results
● People’s needs for training and professional development are determined by results from
periodical appraisals and evaluations of their work
● Appraisal systems: evaluate people’s achievements, as well as gaps in their work performance and
level of adaptability to the changed circumstances
● Methods to train and develop personnel:
○ Introductory training: helps to integrate newly appointed personnel; provide basic
induction information on HRM procedures
○ On-the-job training: used in situations where an employee picks up skills whilst working
alongside a more experienced employee
○ Mentorship: close relationship is established between the experienced and less experienced
person at work
○ Off-the-job training: employees are taken away from their usual places of work to be trained
somewhere else
○ Professional coaching: training a person, or a group of people, with the aim to help to
achieve their professional goals or to develop certain skills
○ Apprenticeship and internship: special agreements between a person who wants to learn a
specific set of skills and an employer who needs a worker of a certain quality; usually
involves young people who are still studying
○ Specialized training in health and safety regulations: training includes accumulating
knowledge on safe working practices, using the equipment in a safe way, maintaining safe
working environment
5.5 E-learning and Distance Learning
● Still not very popular in arts sector
● E-learning: involves use of a computer or an electronic device to provide training or educational
material
● Distance learning: usually combine e-learning methods with offline seminars and lectures
● Advantages: overcomes timing, attendance and travel difficulties and allow easy access from
different locations; eliminates travel, accommodation and administration costs; learning materials
can be reused and adapted easily
● Disadvantage: e-learning platforms and tools are sometimes annoying and not always efficient
(might create frustration); requires higher level of responsibility of respondents; might be difficult
to synchronize people’s schedules
6. Human resource management strategies: and overview
Personnel changes: recruitment/selection for volunteers
7. Example of a ‘human resource management’ section of a strategic plan
Chapter 10 - Financial and Fundraising Plan
1. Basics of financial Planning
● Strategic financial planning is about securing funding for the investment phase of a new venture or
organisation, projecting future revenues, calculating costs of each type of resource, summarizing
financial data to create financial statements, discovering efficient and optimal ways to spend
money, analysing possible financial risks
● Financial information has to be:
○ Accurate, consistent, allow comparisons
○ Gathered, processes on time for each period
○ Relevant, reflection of reality
● Financial information is like a universal language = recognized internationally
● Financial planning aims to determine how to achieve mission, objectives in monetary terms
● Main aims of financial plan:
○ identify the necessary investment costs related to expansion, growth, modernization and
implementation of new technologies;
○ identify the necessary resources for the planned innovations;
○ identify as precisely as possible the financial resources necessary for the implementation of
all functional strategies;
○ consider all potential revenues and sources of external funding (financing);
○ discover the most efficient ways to utilize financial resources;
○ secure sustainable liquidity (ability to pay debt);
○ provide clear, regular and special attention to the flow of financial resources in a given
period of time, especially the cash flow; and
○ consider financial ratios, including the ratio between investment costs and operational cost
and the critical point of return on investments.
● Financial section, important to:
○ Choose most effective model, structure, conditions
○ identify priority areas for future capital investments and innovative projects that might
require major financing;
○ optimize the budget to secure a balance of expenditures with expected incomes;
○ secure stable and long-term relationships with sponsors, foundations, donors and other
external support structures;
○ procure a positive cash-flow balance and account liquidity at all times; and
○ secure management of the organisation without a deficit and with a financial surplus or
profit
2. Budgeting
● Calculation of planned expenses (costs) and revenues (imcomes)
● Provides forecast of how much money is needed for certain period and from where it will be
secured
● Financial viability
● Important for monitoring performance progress
● subsidized /nonprofit organisations = budget = annual financial plan
● Every budget of arts organisation aims: to maximize sources of support and revenues; to keep
expenses at rational level or reduce them
● Revenues
○ From sales of goods, services (self-generated)
○ From additional and peripheral activities with innovative elements
○ From outside sources (sponsors, donors)
○ From financial partnerships, bank interest, government bonds
○ From intangible assets (patents, licenses, trademarks, copyrights)
● Expenditures (costs)
○ Investment costs = starting up
○ Operational costs = running activity
- Direct costs = directly associated with main production process
- Indirect costs = do not change based on the production volume, administration,
gallery maintenance, electricity
○ Financial costs = payment of interest on debts, currency losses, bank changes
● Balance between revenues and expenditures = operating profit/financial surplus
● Net profit = operating profit after expenses and taxes are deducted; used for reinvestment and
dividends
● Surplus = not distributed among owners but must be reserved or reinvested
3. Main financial sources for arts organisations
● Two main groups of revenue and income sources
1. External sources
● Two main groups: Institutional support from government bodies, business
corporations, foundations and funding institutions + Individual support:
● Direct state (public) support
● Support from foundations, funds and trustees = grants, awarded for a specific
project
● Business-sector support for the arts = known as corporate support, corporate
philanthropy = support through corporate foundations or funds, sponsorship,
different forms of corporate donations = sponsorship
● Financial instruments and support from financial institutions = known as alternative
financial instruments
- Unusual instrument of financial management
- Debt instruments = bill, loans, bonds, notes; written promise to repay the
debt, asset-based
- Equity instruments = exchange of money for shared ownership
- Angel investors = retired executives/entrepreneurs invest their own funds
in a startup
- Venture capital = investor for start-ups with high potential for growth
● Individual donations
2. Internal sources
● Sales of core products and services
● Sales of additional and peripheral products and services
● Subscription and membership schemes
3.3 methods using digital and online technologies
● Online fundraising = e-philathropy
○ Easy publicity, cost-effective solution for collection of money, flexibility in changing the
online content and convenience in collecting funds, immediate receipt of transaction,
acknowledgement of donation
● Crowdfinancing (crowdfunding)
- Collective way to support/invest in a project in a limited time frame
- Usually for startups
- Supporters get benefits in return
- Regular updates
- Marketing and promotion while project is still in the making
● Crowdculture
- Innovative model to open up cultural space for wider participation
- Set up multiple regional funds in geographically dispersed places, encouraging grass-roots
exchange between these places
- Local or regional authority or strong private actor
- Like regular crowdfunding model, except that cultural worker can also seek financing from
public funds through the system
- Money pool = private money (members) and public money (part of the cultural budget)
- Gives people the change to affect the cultural offerings = crowdsourcing investment
decisions
● Online fundraising through social networks and mobile devices = facebook, twitter…
● E-commerce
- buying and selling of products and services online
- Allows the overcoming of the barriers of time and distance
- Opportunity to reach global markets
- Helps reduce both the time and the personnel required to complete a transaction
- Lower labour and transaction costs
- Loss of personalized contacts with audiences/buyers
● Main financial sources for:
○ State-subsidized arts organisations = government support
○ Business organisations = revenues
○ Nonprofit = diverse (foundations, state subsidies, donations, charity, subscriptions)
4. Fundraising plan: an overview
● Fundraising = process for identifying, approaching, applying to and gathering support from external
sources
● About building up friendship not just financial relations = because people always give to people
● When self-earned revenues cannot cover all planned expenses, there is a need to elaborate a
separate fundraising plan to fill the envisaged financial gap
● success/failure in fundraising depends on:
○ Popularity, public image
○ Quality of project, strength of cause
○ Team’s previous experience in fundraising
○ Overall team commitment
○ Efficiency of methods used
○ Degree of involvement of personnel
○ Overall media and public visibility
○ Charisma, enthusiasm, personal qualities of the people leading the campaign
● Figure 10.1 = planning the fundraising process: stages
5. Fundraising from foundations: project proposal
● Foundations = exist to accumulate assets from variety of sources in diverse ways and distribute
them in form of grants to unrelated organisations/individuals for specific purposes
5.1 foundations’ criteria
● Private foundations = accumulate funds from part of the annual profit
● Public foundations = are set up by public authorities and accumulate funds on national, regional,
municipal levels from government money or diverse public-private financial schemes, state
supervision
● Hundreds of foundations around the world = important to carefully plan the process of seeking the
right foundation to apply
● Fundraising is also fund-spending
● Types of foundations
○ Ownership and main source of funding = state and public foundations (government),
corporate foundations (business company), community foundations (result of collective
will), private or family foundations (family members)
○ Ways foundations establish their policies and grant programs = grant-giving, operational,
mixed
○ Aims = multipurpose, or general, specific,
○ Geographical coverage = international, national, regional, local
=> foundations announce in advance their criteria for selection
5.2 elaborating a project proposal
● A well-structured project proposal contains:
○ Résumé = short explanation of idea, objectives, problem, time frame, phases of creative
production, target groups, results, costs, sum of money requested
○ Context = description of overall framework and circumstances, situational analysis and
rationale
○ Target groups
○ Action plan = activities related to the project
○ Project team = competences, skills, experience of people involved
○ Collaborators and partners
○ Project budget = expected expenditures and revenues
○ Expected results
○ Project sustainability
○ Appendices = history of organisation, legal status documents, curricula vitae, publicity
materials
6. Gaining support from sponsors
● Sponsors expect something in return
6.1 mutual benefits
6.2 reasons for sponsoring and differences from foundations’ support
● Questions that sponsors might ask before sponsoring:
○ Main reasons: why is it of benefit
○ Similarities
○ Professionalisms and artistic quality
○ Market coverage (participation)
○ Media coverage (visibility)
○ Scope
○ Location
○ Frequency
○ Time frame
○ Financial planning
○ Reliability
6.3 Sponsorship proposal
● Part of overall fundraising plan
● Short, attractive, understandable, grab attention
6.4 Planning the approach to potential sponsors
● Questions to be answered to plan sponsorship process:
○ How well does the sponsorship match aims and objectives?
○ For which programmes and events could sponsorship be an effective way of gaining
additional support? Why?
○ Why deserve sponsorship?
○ Size and reputation of arts organisation and the potential sponsors, how do they match?
○ What is the ‘benefits package’ provided in return for the sponsor’s financial and in-kind
support?
○ How will the overall visibility and media coverage attract sponsors?
● Reasons to refuse sponsorship:
○ Inappropriate timing of application
○ Lack of available personnel/policy in company of sponsorship
○ Lack of compatibility between project and targeted market
○ Company doesn’t want to be seen sponsoring many projects
○ Absence of favourable legislation for sponsorship
7. Fundraising through charity events and individual donations
● Factors that determine successful planning of charity events:
○ Defining and explaining cause
○ Understanding the potential motivations of individual donors
○ Securing visibility and media coverage
○ Building transparency, public accountability and trust
○ Involving volunteers during the event
○ Including elements of fun and amusement
● Benefits of charity events: increase public recognition, improve audience relations, gain supporters,
make new friends
● BUT require a lot + time consuming
● Effectiveness can be measured by:
○ Sum of money collected
○ Time, money, efforts invested vs results achieved
○ Number of individual donors attracted
○ Increase in number of supporters and friends
○ Number of articles, press interviews
○ Number of online users
8. Accounting process: an overview
● Accounting is a set of activities which involve gathering, processing, recording, analysing and
summarizing transactions and events from a financial point of view and in a way that meets legal
regulations, restrictions and rules
● principles of accounting for business and nonprofit organisations, differ for each country depending
on the national or regional legislation
● Accounting models:
○ Accrual method = recognizes revenues at moment they are earned; expenditures at moment
when the materials/services are received
○ Cash basis = recognizes revenues/expenditures at moment when cash is received
○ Depreciation = method to spread costs of a tangible capital asset over several years
○ Double-entry = tracks where money comes from and where it goes to (two accounts)
9. Main financial statements
● Main financial documents which form the basis for analysis of the organisation’s performance:
○ Balance sheet
○ Income statement (profit and loss account)
○ Cash-flow statement
● Financial reporting: refers to preparation and submission of the three statements: balance sheet,
income statement and cash-flow statement. In the strategic planning process, these statements are
elaborated as a prognosis for the future and become the core of the financial plan
9.1 Balance Sheet
● Mirrors the financial relationship between the organisation and its economic environment
(suppliers, clients, creditors and others)
● Static documents (shows financial situation of an organisation at a particular moment)
● Consists of two main parts:
○ Assets: show all financial and material resources (anything having and economic value)
which are at disposal of the organisation and can be activated for realization of the
organisation’s goals; can be split into different categories; current assets show the liquidity
of an organisation; organisation obtains its assets from two main sources (internal (capital
of shareholders of self-invested capital) and external (funds, loans etc))
○ Liabilities: show all obligations or legal debts that arise over time during business
operations; show the sources of financing in an arts organisation; in case of external
financing, liabilities show from whom the resources (assets= are taken and/or to whom
they belong
■ Current liabilities: expected to be payable within one year
■ Long-term liabilities: debts payable over a longer period
● Balance sheet must follow the formula: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ (/Owner’s) Equity
9.2 Income Statement (Profit and Loss Account)
● Historical record or a summary of business transactions over a given period (usually a year)
● Shows whether an organisation has made a profit or loss at the end of a financial period
● Shows differences between organisation’s total revenues and total costs
● Main principle for preparing this statement is to group costs and revenues based on their nature
and source
9.3 Cash-Flow Statement
● Follows the money coming into the organisation, the money going out and the money which is
available in cash or in the bank account(s) of the organisation during a certain period of time (day,
week, month, quarter, year)
● Dynamic document → ‘money in’, ‘money out’, ‘money net’
● Cash management is very important because cash is required for
○ Transactions
○ Risk and safety (to meet unexpected situations)
○ Investment
○ Discrepancies (between the date of the event and the date the funds arrive)
● Cash requires dual signature because it can be easily misused
10. Interpreting financial information
● Indicators of a business company’s financial health and performance are called financial ratios
(calculated from financial statements)
○ Widely used as a forecast as they predict future trends
● Technique for interpreting and comparing financial ratios: ratio analysis → summarizes and
compares the results of activities and business transactions and relationships between different
variables
○ Internal comparisons; consider the following:
■ Different time periods of an organisation’s own history
■ Budgets and targets
■ Organisation’s internal departments and units
● Ratios help for external comparison with other similar organisations or standards in the field
● External users of financial reports and ratios: investors, banks, lenders, suppliers and tax and other
government authorities
● Categories of financial ratios:
○ Liquidity ratio: shows ability of an organisation to pay its short-term debts
○ Profitability ratio: focus on ability to utilize its resources in generating profit and
shareholder value
○ Financial leverage ratio: indicate extent to which the business relies on debt financing
○ Debt ratio: general picture of organisation’s overall debt
○ Operating ratio: show management efficiency
● Ratio analysis to businesses is only partially applicable to nonprofit organisations (examples on p.
275)
● Limitations of ratios; they could also be misleading; require management analysis and
interpretation
11. Example of a ‘financial and fundraising’ section of a strategic plan
Chapter 11 - Implementation, Monitoring and Strategic Reflection
1. Implementation and monitoring
● Measurements of results, overall evaluation, corrective action for next strategic planning cycle
● Implementation = key; transforms a concept into real action
● Implementation process requires:
○ Translation of long-term objectives into operational objectives = to be understood by
everyone
○ Preparation of operational plans and project plans = to achieve long-term objectives
○ Outlining of individual assignments
○ Ongoing monitoring
● Implementation usually in hands of general manager/artistic director
● Main focus = make everyone believe that strategic plan helps in daily work as it provides direction
and the means to perform activities
2. Performance indicators
● Measurements in time periods
● Established key performance indicators
● Reasons = learn from mistakes, improve further, report to external stakeholders, comply with
reporting regulations, monitor people’s behaviour and actions
● project -monitoring indicators:
○ Indicators for artistic quality
○ Indicators for the project’s implementation stages
○ Indicators for partnership, collaboration and networking
○ Indicators for target groups/outreach
○ Indicators for promotion and communication
○ Indicators for organisational/managerial aspects
○ Financial indicators
3. Risk management
● In the process of the plan’s implementation it is important to also manage operational risks.
Anticipating in advance what could go wrong and why, and trying to prevent that or to decrease the
consequences if it does happen, is part of the plan’s implementation process
● Areas to consider:
○ Anticipating the risks
○ Clarifying the necessary management and other tools needed to diminish the risks
○ Solving the problems when they occur (sudden problems)
○ Preparing a contingency plan (plan B)
4. Working with volunteers
● One way to decrease labour costs is to use volunteers
● Benefits for organisation:
○ Enthusiastic and willing to learn
○ Do it for fun, contacts, image
○ Use it as learning experience
○ Few demands, expectations
○ Cost less money, but require more coordination and training
● Benefits for volunteer:
○ Develop professionally, gain experience
○ Learn new skills
○ Insider perspective
○ Gain visibility
○ Increase professional contacts
○ Have fun, meet new people
● Stages to identify volunteers:
○ Identify tasks and activities and preparing task descriptions
○ Develop applicable procedures for attracting volunteers
○ Recruitment
○ Orientation, training sessions
○ informing/training staff how to handle volunteers
○ Supervision, mentoring
○ Evaluation at end of volunteering service
○ Recognizing, thanking volunteers for service
● Elderly volunteers = moral, ethical, patriotic, emotional, psychological motivations
● Younger volunteers = professional skills, competences, motivations
● Evaluation of volunteers process by certain indicators:
○ Number of volunteers
○ Number of volunteer hours
○ Percentage of increase/decrease in voluntary participation
○ Feedback from volunteers
5. Final evaluation
● Evaluation of success in implementing a plan and achieving final results can be done based on many
methods:
○ Compare preliminary established indicators with the initial set of objectives;
○ Process and analyse client, audience, stakeholder and community feedback;
○ Perform observation and monitoring by managers; and
○ Use of consultants and external experts who are invited to analyse and evaluate the final
results.
● Final evaluation based on:
○ Extent to which project helps realization of objectives
○ Level of achieved functional objectives
○ Improvement of artistic quality, creativity
○ Level of development of innovative activities, increase in innovative potential
○ Level of intrapreneurial climate
○ Level of effective use of resources
○ Level of satisfaction, involvement of audience, clients, target group
○ Level of satisfaction of funding bodies
○ Level of self-generated revenues
○ Level of improvement of image, reputation in society, among immediate community
○ Increase in visibility of creative production and project results
○ Level of improvement in organisational/managerial capacity
○ Level of professional collaboration and networking
○ Level of engagement in solving social and ecological problems
○ Level of sustainability achieved in: financial, environmental, community
6. Sustainable approach to plan implementation
● ‘sustainability is about living and working in ways that meet and integrate existing environmental,
economic and social needs without compromising the well-being of future generations’
● Four pillars of sustainability = culture as a fourth dimension of sustainability, environmental
responsibility, economic health, social equity
● A sustainable approach to a strategic plan’s implementation considers the following trends/factors:
○ Arts organisations as open systems of interactions
- Interacting with external social, economic, political environment
○ Arts organisations as ‘messengers’ of sustainability
○ Interdisciplinary aspects
- Between art disciplines, between environment, health care, education, social areas
○ Sustainable art
○ Global connectivity
○ Sustainable operational management
○ Support of communities through the arts
○ Financial sustainability
7. Communicating results
● communicate evaluation results to board, funding bodies, government officials, audiences, partners,
stakeholders
● Two versions:
○ Internal use: for board, trustees, committees, managers, partners, contractors
○ External use: media coverage, audiences, communities, general public
ARTICLES
Svejenova (2005) - ‘The Path with the Heart’: Creating the Authentic Career
● Theory of authenticity-driven career creation
Introduction
● New interest in the self as the promoter of the career
● Individuals as causal agents of their environment
● Identity as self-efficacy and authenticity has been considered an important dimension in
constructing boundaryless careers
● Influence of ‘milieus’ such as careers, market, industry structure etc.
○ Peterson and Anand (2004): six facets of production (technology, law and regulation,
industry structure, organization structure, occupational career, and market) →
interdependent
● In her study, she wants to examine the role of authenticity in the creation of a creative career with
micro-level analysis
○ In-depth case study of a renowned Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar
○ Developing model of an authenticity-driven career
■ 4 stages (exploration, focus, independence, and professionalism)
○ Pattern of the career in its entirety
Individual Identity
● Identity is the content and organization of self-concept
● Identity can be viewed as consisting of a private self (the way, the person really is), and a public self
(manifested or presented to others; attributed by others to individual)
● Identity is continuously changing
● Provides energy to action and, simultaneously, continues to discover and reshape itself in action
● Created through language and other representations (e.g. photographs)
● Authenticity
○ Acting in one’s own authority
○ Being truthful to oneself
○ Achieving congruence between feelings and communication
○ Being distinctive and coherent
○ Authenticity as agency → responsibility; choices should be coherent with past or with
envisioned future
Research methodology
● Study design: inductive, open-ended
● Data collection: 1999-2001, semi-structured interviews, press archive
● Data analysis: theory development, microanalysis; identification of relevant career stages
Case Study: An Authenticity-triggered creative career
● Spanish film industry: fragmented (large number of small producers)
● Almodóvar’s career
○ His novel, provocative and initially technically impure style not only arouse controversy
among film critics but also attracted the attention of the audience
○ Oscar-nomination
○ Cannes best director prize
○ Personal and homegrown career path
○ 4 career stages can be distinguished → table p. 956f.
■ 1. Amateur years (1973-80) → exploration
● Outsider in cinema field
● Organizing viewings by himself in small venues → these events were
considered happenings
● Could not afford technical professionals; actors were unpaid volunteers →
he said that the absence of financial means provides freedom of creativity
■ 2. Focus on cinema and becoming a professional director (1981-85) → focus
● Produced feature films (they became ‘cultural icon’ of social transition from
dictatorship to democracy in Spain) → made him known to critics on film
festival
● Focused on feature film making and left permanent employment
● Production through subsidy system
● Already considered ‘professional’
● But: disagreements with producers of films that supported him →
constraints to authenticity
■ 3. Establishment of own production company to enhance control over his movies,
achievement of international success (1986-90) → independence
● Gained artistic and economic control over his projects
● International visibility and recognition
● His way of producing films became a trademark
● Films were less underground but not more mainstream
■ 4. Renewal to professional maturity (1991- ) → professionalism
● Perfecting his movies, quest for professionalism
● Forming of permanent production team
● Novel discourse strategies such as self-interviews
● Reason for recognition: continuous zeal for evolution and professionalism
■ → removal of limitations to authenticity triggers the career
● Change in authenticity work
○ For stages depict differences in authenticity work
○ Audiences portray a specific challenge to shape the changing needs for identity expression
○ Second stage: Spanish audience, third stage: international audiences (this opened new
challenges because of, e.g. dubbing his characters)
● Continuity in authenticity work
○ Recognizable ‘signature’ over time (e.g. same topics)
● Context
○ Depending on where his films are presented
Creating a creative career: the path of authenticity
● Authenticity work is in the duality of identity expression and image manufacturing
● It has some elements that are consistent over time and others that keep changing → creative career
is shaped in the combination of continuity and change in the artist’s public and private selves
● Process model: to explain how a creative career is shaped through authenticity work
● Model
○ Career trajectory driven by one’s vision, central values and most loved talents and
potentialities → ‘path with the heart’
○ Jones’ model: four stages which the creative professionals follow
■ Beginning a career
■ Crafting the career
■ Navigating the career
■ Maintaining the career
○ Svejenova’s model is more focused on the combination of career trajectory and authenticity
■ Exploration
● Authenticity work as exploration of range of roles or possible selves
● Complex and multivalent identities are good to be able to interact with
multiple audiences and to engage in difficult role transitions; BUT they can
be also confusing or overarching
■ Focus
● Focusing on a particular role identity → in-depth exploration by developing
a signature style
● Collective identity is valued
■ Independence
● Individual autonomy is valued
● Establishing one’s own company or team is one of the mechanisms that
creative individuals use to enhance their control over the aesthetic and
economic aspects of their projects
■ Professionalism
● Authenticity work of creative individuals is directed at the mastery of both
thee art form and the way in which the creator communicates and engages
with the relevant audiences
● Ability to develop a continuous and coherent body of work over time is
valued
● Quest for professionalism = quest for continuity
● Certain constraints and threats to authenticity: success and fame may
destroy the interaction with different audiences; major challenge: enhance
experimentation and reinvention while keeping consistent at the same time
○ Important aspects of this model
■ Audiences: through interaction with the creator, audiences partake in authenticity
work and in the creation of a creative career → with attention to interaction
■ persona/person-model of onion → layeredness of identity
■ Structural context: actions and interactions are embedded structurally and
historically
Conclusion
● Authenticity as a shaper of meaningful careers in creative industries → in four stages/levels
● Actor’s pursuit of authenticity paves the way to his recognition and legitimation
● Authenticity is, both a motor and an anchor for careers → duality of continuity and change
● Gives limitations of study and ideas for further research
● Responsibility and initiative for one’s career have been shifted from the organization to the
individual
● Being true to oneself (therefore, authentic) can prove to be a valuable career anchor in a complex,
vibrant, and fragmented world
Wijnberg and Gemser (2000) - Adding Value to Innovation: Impressionism and the Transformation of
the Selection System in Visual Arts
● How valuation of cultural products takes place by describing the changing role and significance of
different types of selection systems
● 3 types of selection systems: market selection, peer selection, and expert selection
● In impressionism, innovation has become the most highly prized product characteristic
● Evaluation of cultural products is problematic, however, some kind of values must be assigned to
most cultural products
● Analysis of different types of selection systems
● Focus on visual arts industry and in particular on one group of painters: impressionists
○ Most of these painters get value attributed to the innovative aspects of their style of
painting
The impact of selection systems on the value of innovation
● Each selection system describes generally the competitive process: the way in which winners are
distinguished from losers
● Market selection
○ Producers are the selected in the consumers are the selectors
● Peer selection
○ Selectors and selected are part of the same group
● Expert selection
○ Selectors are neither producers nor consumers, but have the power to shape selection by
virtue of specialized knowledge and distinctive abilities
● → these three types are ideal types and in reality they are often combined
● In many forms of cultural industries, recognition and attribution of value is strongly linked to
product differentiation
○ E.g. through the use of innovation
■ An innovation attains value only if it is considered valuable by the selectors that
control a given selection system
■ Because of the peer selection system, innovation in art was often a problem → when
art containing radical or revolutionary innovations secceeds, it often does so in
conjunction with a change in the selection system
■ This happened in visual arts industry at the turn of the century: shift from peer to
expert selection system together with innovation becoming the main value
● Experts derived their legitimacy and importance from being among the first
to recognize the value of new entrants into the visual arts industry →
innovation became important
The role of museums, dealers, and critics in the rise Impressionists
● Impressionist: to create the sensation of capturing the fleeting impression of a particular scene at a
specific moment in time
● Their success is also dependent on the shift towards the expert-based selection system (before:
peer selection) → this increased the strategic value of being innovative (the impressionists wanted
to be independent from academia which did not value innovativeness)
● White and White (1993): ‘dealer critics system’
● The Art Museum: served as a repository for the works of dead artists and as a school for training
young artists until 19th century where it got a more active role in exhibiting artworks or current
artists → the certified artists that were still alive → trends and values were established and modern
museums began to value art in terms of its innovativeness (significant shift away from existing
styles)
● The ideological dealer: exhibitions became commercially (artworks that were shown could be
bought) and in the 18th century, the Salons (exhibitions organized by French Academy) became
most important way to show one’s work → the career of painters was largely dependent on these
salons; the jury of the salons was largely existing from members of the French Academy, therefore,
impressionist painters had a hard time to get in → the impressionists began their own exhibitions
which were semi-successful; BUT, then, the growth importance of commercial art galleries lead to
support for the impressionists because their paintings were exhibited there and brought financial
support; often, the art dealers had a certain ideology (style/period etc.) to make selling more
virtuous and profitable
● The Art critic: Salons contributed to the birth of a new category of experts: journalistic-art critics
(for specialized journals etc.; e.g. Zola, Mirbeau); the relation between critics and artists with
respect to credentials worked both ways (artists needed to convince critics and critics had to prove
their own worth and credentials); also the dealers looked at the critics for support; positive reviews
on the innovativeness of impressionist artworks enhanced their value
Discussion and implications
● Three elements that played a key role in the shift of the selection system towards on based on
experts:
○ Ideological dealers which were assisted by art critics
○ Modern art museums which began to exhibit innovative artworks
● → these three had the purpose of the establishment and defense of the credentials of a group of
artists for being innovative → positive feedback loops
● Since then, innovation became a main value/criterion for art; nowadays, often, only the work if
innovators has remained valuable while much of the work of contemporaneous academic painters
has disappeared or is only valued as a curiosity
● The position of experts is important because innovativeness is difficult to evaluate for the average
consumer
● The change in the selection system of impressionist art led to a general change of how art is
evaluate nowadays
● Avant-movements today are inherently unstable because of the dynamism of the processes
described in this paper
● Growing importance of various forms of experts nowadays
Van den Hoogen (2018) - Values in crowdfunding in the Netherlands
● Outcomes of empirical research on crowdfunding in the Netherlands via the Voordekunst website
○ Not-for-profit website which collaborates with several private and public art funds,
providing the largest platform for ‘project makers’ and donors in the arts in the Netherlands
● Value orientation of Dutch crowdfunders is researched using the value sociology of Boltanski and
Thévenot
Introduction
● Crowdfunding as new method of funding to work against the large budget cuts in the cultural sector
● Some private art funds have started collaborating with Voordekunst → they are donating their
money through this channel
● Crowdfunding does seem to promise a market orientation as it allows individual ‘users’ of cultural
and artistic products access to decisions on funding production and the dissemination of these
products
● Voordekunst allows for a simultaneous focus on funding and marketing as the funding method
creates a community around the makers or their project
● → which values drive crowdfunders?
Hypotheses
● B & Th argue that people legitimize their actions in and evaluations of social situations based on a
set of values → ‘value regimes’ (they develop and change over time)
● Value regimes can be compared on a large scale because they are not dependent on, e.g., the
country, policies etc.
● → comparing the values that drive crowdfunder and public funders of theatre in the Netherlands
● Crowdfunding: dominance of the inspirational value regime
● Public subsidies: dominance of civic value regime
● Donations and rewards:
○ In crowdfunding, donors can receive a reward depending on the amount of money they
spent
Empirical research setup
● Voordekunst
○ Aim: to realize cultural projects → made possible by the people for whom culture is
ultimately intended (the ‘crowd’, the public)
○ The organisation gives advice to the artists who set their projects on the website
The values on the website
● Staff does screen projects before they are published on Voordekunst: check whether projects are
realistic and viable for crowdfunding; campaign itself is run by project maker
The values stressed by project makers
● Project makers stress a particular concept which represents an artistic vision or theme or is very
personal in nature; concept can also relate to a particular part of history and tradition or stress
societal issues
● Inspirational regime is the dominant one; also: fame and project city regime which are invoked to
promote a project’s core values; also: market regime because the project makers indicate the
service that will be provided in return for the donation
The values of Voordekunst donors
● Values represent what potential donors might want to ‘see’ in project proposals
● Civic and inspirational values seem to be most important, followed by industrial
● Market values are least important
● Differences between frequent and infrequent donors
○ Frequent: focus on project content, tend to be colleagues of project makers, focus on talent
development in some art disciplines → more ‘professional’ attitude
● Inspired and civic values: the content if the project and the relevance of art and culture to society
score highest; next is the expertise of the project makers (industrial values) and the fact that the
donation can make to project a success (market)
● Service offered in return is not ranked very highly (many donors even do not want this) but more
important than fame and domestic values
Conclusions
● Crowdfunders are first and foremost motivated by civic and inspired values → relevance of art and
culture to society and the content of project proposals, the autonomy of the artist and artistic
development are the most important values for donating
● Also expertise of project makers is important (industrial value, market value)
● Service offered in return (also market) and makers’ image (fame) are important supportive values
only
● Competitiveness and economic impact of the arts are barely relevant
● Differences between art disciplines are small
(comparison with the hypotheses about values driving crowdfunding)
(comparison with Dutch theatre funding and policy implications)
